        Starting in the upper reaches of 5 Mile near the trailhead for Tinfoil Hat Downhill and Andreas' Downhill, this southbound trail traverses a very nice bench land with several small creek crossings and some lovely mixed forests. The trail ends at the Packsaddle Creek parking area. If traveled in reverse (from the Packsaddle Creek parking area), the Selwyn Traverse becomes a long, continuous uphill; the grade is never severe but the uphill climb is unrelenting.

        <b>Kinney Lake</b> (0 - 5.5 miles, flat with some very gradual uphill)<br>
Berg Lake Trail starts by crossing the swift flowing Robson River, and then following it upstream to Kinney Lake. Here the trail is in fir forest. Robson River can be seen to the right. Occasionally, through breaks in the trees, Mt. Robson can be seen ahead. About 2.6 miles from the trailhead, at the Kinney Lake outlet, the trail crosses Robson River on a sturdy bridge. Kinney Lake, a beautiful turquoise lake, then comes into view. From here, the trail follows the Kinney Lake shore around the south end of the lake, and up its northeast shoreline. At mile 4.4, at the end of the lake, the trail reaches Kinney Flats. Kinney Flats is an open area of mud flats crisscrossed by inlet streams to Kinney Lake. The trail goes along the side of Kinney Flats and then crosses them. Make sure to stay on the trail here and take the bridges across the streams and wettest areas.<br>
<br>
<b>Robson River</b> (5.5 miles- 7.1 miles, short climb and then flat)<br>
At 5.5 miles from its trailhead, Berg Lake Trail leaves Kinney Lake/Flats behind and re-enters the fir forest. The trail climbs for about 0.5 miles, and then levels off, as it returns to following Robson River upstream. The river is below the trail on the right. To the left, the forested hillsides rise steeply. At mile 6.5, the trail emerges from the forest to cross Robson River on a suspension bridge. The trail then veers left along the banks of Robson River. This trail section is wide open with steep cliffs laced with waterfalls, across Robson River.<br>
<br>
<b>Valley of a Thousand Falls</b> (7.1 miles - 9.2 miles, CLIMB)<br>
At about mile 7.1, Berg Lake Trail turns a bend to the right, enters Valley of a Thousand Falls, and begins to climb. Robson River is crossed again, and is now to the right. So are the waterfalls, all 1,000 or so of them. The trail climbs, and Climbs, and CLIMBS, as Robson River cascades down White Falls, Falls of the Pool, Emperor Falls, and more falls.<br>
<br>
<b>Berg Lake Valley</b> (9.2 miles - 13.8 miles, flat)<br>
At mile 9.2, Berg Lake Trail emerges from the forest to go along a large meadow to the right, that is crisscrossed with Berg Lake outlet streams. To the left is a scree hillside. Berg Lake is reached at mile 10.9, its turquoise waters to the right of the trail. To the left is forest. Across Berg Lake is Mt. Robson with its glaciers flowing into Berg Lake. The trail reaches the north end of Berg Lake at mile 12.1, and continues across beautiful land to reach Alberta at mile 13.8 where it becomes Moose River Route.

        This trail is a long slog up switchbacks along well defined and well maintained trail to the alpine. Once in the alpine, the route is marked by red paint on rocks. Hikers should be aware that there is a lot of scree and small boulders to navigate through. The true summit is fairly exposed, and there is a short scramble up and down a couple dips along the summit ridge before actually reaching the peak.

        Snowbird Pass Route is a challenging, rewarding hike to Snowbird Pass from any of the Berg Lake area trail camps. Whether or not one gets all the way to Snowbird Pass, there is dramatic beauty all along the way. The Snowbird Pass Route Trailhead is well marked by a trail sign on the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a>.<br>
<br>
Snowbird Pass Route starts off flat in the meadows of the Berg Lake Valley. The trail reaches the Robson River almost immediately, and then follows the silt-laden water up to its source at the small, glacier-fed Robson Lake.<br>
<br>
Leaving the meadows behind, and now on rock, the trail reaches Robson Lake about 0.9 miles from the trailhead. From here, the trail runs next to Robson Lake to its left. About 1.4 miles from the trailhead, the trail turns left to climb rocks to the top of a glacial moraine. This is a lateral moraine from Robson Glacier that can be seen ahead flowing down into Robson Lake. The trail becomes difficult to follow for about 0.6 miles as it climbs this moraine—look for cairns and red rectangles. <br>
<br>
Still climbing the moraine about 2 miles from the trailhead, the trail becomes more obvious as it climbs a few switchbacks to reach the top of the moraine. At this point, the trail is at the far end of Robson Lake that can be seen far below, with Robson Glacier calving into it. Robson Glacier is up close and straight ahead. Snowy Resplendent Mountain and many others are behind Robson Glacier. Rearguard Mountain, with Mt. Robson behind it, is just across Robson Lake/Glacier to the right.<br>
<br>
Now up on the moraine, the trail is flat and easy to follow again as it runs along the top of the rocky moraine next to Robson Glacier below. After about a mile on the moraine, a creek is heard ahead. This creek is tumbling down a waterfall from the (unseen) high meadows to the left of the trail. Just before reaching the creek/waterfall about 3.5 miles from the trailhead, the trail veers left to go up a few switchbacks to get to the high meadows. If you are short of time, or energy, if you make the goal to at least get to this point the hike is still well worth it as the view from this point is one of the best in the area.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the high meadows, the trail follows the creek to the right. Lynx Mountain is ahead to the right and Titkana Peak is in the distance to the left, with Snowbird Pass between them. The trail heads over the meadows toward the pass. About 0.5 miles below the pass, now on rock, the trail makes a final climb to reach Snowbird Pass.

        The Lake Loop is a great trail for completing a full lap of the Rose Valley Reservoir. Hikers will find the trailhead along the service road leading to Rose Valley Dam. There is a dump yard on the left approximately 150 meters from the dam, and the trailhead runs through there.  <br>
<br>
Most of the heavy lifting is in the first km of the trail, as 30+ switchbacks gain most of the elevation in the hike. Luckily, the trail is well-built.<br>
<br>
The starting section of this route shares the tread with a trail called Daze of Roses and will connect to a relatively new cut out called ""Sweet Street"".  Once you circle the reservoir you end up at the base of Swamp Donkey which is a great ascent up and out to your vehicle at the Elementary School.

        This trail begins at the youth hostel - but you are not supposed to park there unless you are a guest. There is parking available further along the road at the Takakkaw Falls parking area. Find the trail at the west side of the parking area. <br>
<br>
The trail is well built and starts climbing the east slope of The President on some great switchbacks. Most of the work is right here at the beginning. As you gain some ground, look for the excellent views of Takakkaw Falls behind you to the east. <br>
<br>
When you emerge from the forest at treeline, the views in every direction get better. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy the views as you'll be above the treeline for nearly the rest of the trail. Keep checking out the Cathedral Crags to the south, Takakkaw Falls to the east, and Yoho Glacier to the north. <br>
<br>
If it is clear enough, The President will be towering over you as well. When you curve around The President, you'll descend a little into the forest of Little Yoho Valley. Finally, cross the river on a bridge to the Alpine Club of Canada, Stanley Mitchell Hut.

        Start up the trail and cross a bridge before you come to a fork with the Mike Lake Trail. Continue right and you'll soon be looking up the portion of the trail also known as the Incline Trail. This is a long, straight, rocky trail. Just before the mile you'll come out onto the fire road. Turn right and follow the smooth wide fire road for awhile. Watch for the trail sign and picnic table on your right. There is a view through the tree at this point. <br>
<br>
Continue on and just after a sweeping switchback on the road watch for the trail on your right (you could continue on the fire road, which may be easier to navigate, but this shortcut is the Alouette Trail). This next portion is a steep climb with step ups and rocks at times. Emerge onto the fire road again after a short time and continue to your right. The fire road will pass through a helicopter landing area and will soon become less and less road and more and more singletrack, rocky trail. <br>
<br>
Just after mile 4, the trail turns to the right (with a trail intersecting on the left). The climb becomes more intense now with many steps ups and one small ladder. Eventually, you'll see a large rock wall to your left. The trail will soon flatten and the view will open up to an alpine forest. You'll head left and up one last climb before reaching the top of Alouette Mountain. From here, depending on the day, you'll have 360-degree views of BC with Blanshard Peak just a short distance away dominating the northern view.

        Lake of the Hanging Glacier Trail starts at a parking area at the end of Horsethief Creek Forest Service Road.  Despite the long forest service road drive, this is a popular trail for day hikes.<br>
<br>
Entering the beautiful fir forest, the trail climbs above Horsethief Creek. Enjoying a flat stretch in the forest, the trail then veers away from the creek for about a half mile, before returning back to run along the banks of the creek briefly. At the 1.0 mile mark, the trail again veers away from Horsethief Creek, to climb steeply to Hell Roaring Creek and cross it at the 1.5 mile mark.  After crossing Hell Roaring Creek, the trail returns to Horsethief Creek and crosses it on an amazing metal bridge at the 1.9 mile mark. The trail then follows Horsethief Creek upstream for a little over a half mile.<br>
<br>
At the 2.5 mile mark, the trail veers left/southeast to leave Horsethief Creek and come to a smaller creek that empties into Horsethief Creek. This smaller creek is the Lake of the Hanging Glacier outlet creek. The trail follows the lake's outlet creek upstream to eventually arrive at the lake.<br>
<br>
The initial mile following the lake's outlet creek is a steep forested climb, with some switchbacks to help the climb.  Throughout this climb the creek can be seen cascading down.  The climb then eases and the trail slowly emerges from the forest into alpine meadows. A lovely trail camp is passed on the right/west at the 4.3 mile mark.  Ahead, there is another rise with a neat waterfall flowing down it. Cresting the rise, The Lieutenants, the mountains behind Lake of the Hanging Glacier, begin to appear.  At the top of the rise, a large talus field is crossed to finally reach Lake of the Hanging Glacier, a very pretty, large glacial lake.  Several small glaciers flow down from the Lieutenants toward the lake, the largest being Jumbo Glacier.

        Mumm Basin Route is great for day hiking if you are staying at one of the trail camps in the Berg Lake area. It can be combined with <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039404/hargreaves-lake-route"">Hargreaves Lake Route</a> to make a wonderful loop from the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a>. The Mumm Basin Route trailhead is on the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> at Robson Pass Trail Camp. This is well marked by a sign.<br>
<br>
Mumm Basin Route starts through the fir forest with lush undergrowth. Almost immediately, it begins to climb. As it climbs, it soon begins to follow a creek to the right of the trail. Views of the surrounding mountains, glaciers, rivers, and lakes slowly emerge as the trail climbs, and the trees shorten and thin. About 0.7 miles from the trailhead, the trail bends right to head northeast and cross into Alberta about 0.9 miles from the trailhead. By now, the trail is almost at treeline. The trees are sparser and shorter, as the trail runs through a mix of rock and trees. Here on the Continental Divide, several lakes can clearly be seen—Lake Adolphus in Alberta, Berg Lake, and several more small lakes. The head waters of Robson River in the snow-covered peaks and glaciers of the Continental Divide can be seen, as the Robson River starts its journey to the Pacific Ocean. To the north, in Alberta, the Smoky River whose waters eventually reach the Arctic Ocean, starts as the Adolphus Lake outlet stream.<br>
<br>
Mumm Basin Route continues to climb as it travels over rock now, and is marked by cairns to show the way. The trail soon bends left and crosses back into British Columbia, again on the Continental Divide, and at the trail's high point, about 1.1 miles from the trailhead.<br>
<br>
At this point, Mumm Basin Route levels off for about the next mile, as it travels through rocky meadows above treeline. A few streams are crossed and there are high peaks to the right (northwest) of the trail. The views to the left are awesome—Mt Robson, Rearguard Mountain, and many other snowy peaks; Berg Glacier, Robson Glacier, and more glaciers; Berg Lake, Adolphus Lake, and other small lakes; and in general the expansive rugged splendor of the mountains and valleys of the Continental Divide.<br>
<br>
About 2.3 miles from its trailhead, Mumm Basin Route begins to slowly descend. As it descends, it gradually re-enters the fir forest. A trail junction is soon reached. Here, Mumm Basin Route ends as it meets <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039404/hargreaves-lake-route"">Hargreaves Lake Route</a> and Toboggan Falls Route.

In 1807, First Nations people guided David Thompson, a fur trader who extensively mapped Alberta and British Columbia, over Howse Pass and down the Blaeberry River along this route, thus opening it to the fur trade. By the second half of the 20th century though, this section from Howse Pass down the Blaeberry RIver was used only as a remote hiking trail, although it was (and is) part of the <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.greatdividetrail.com"">GDT (Great Divide Trail)</a>.

Volunteers have put rocks across so you can save your shoes from getting wet. Watch for fallen trees as well although they are usually cleared up fairly quickly. <br>
<br>
You'll be sharing this trail with horses and other foot traffic, but sightings are rare. After about a third of the way into the trail, it starts to descend slightly, pretty much until you meet up with the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7013048/thornhill-trail"">Thornhill Trail</a>. Wear a bear bell during bear season.

This trail is extremely easy, and all of the bluffs are gated off, so don't worry about slipping off. Eventually, the trail will make a sharp left turn. Soon after this you'll arrive at the Twin Falls bridge. The trail ends on the other side of it.

        The trail leaves the forest service road before Murdo Creek and continues uphill through second-growth forest. After roughly half an hour of hiking up this trail, you'll emerge at McKay Lake. This small but beautiful lake lies at the foot of a tall cliff beneath Mount St. Benedict. The trail skirts around the lake to the left for a few paces before it hits the point where Murdo Creek drains out of the lake. Several logs have dammed the mouth of the lake, which you must hike across before continuing up the trail.<br>
<br>
Now the trail leaves the lake and quickly becomes very steep. It climbs straight up through the forest to a saddle between Mount St. Benedict and a peak to the north. From here, you get your first glimpse into the neighboring valley to the east (presumably with Cascade Creek at the bottom). The trail now leads to the right along a ridge and flattens out to a pond and very small meadow at the base of another steep cliff. The final peak of Mount St. Benedict looms overhead. The trail leads to the left of the pond, and curls around the side of the cliff, climbing to the top of Mount St. Benedict.

Approximate time to the top will vary with your pace, but when we visited it was about 30 to 40 minutes. There are picnic tables near the end that make for a wonderful lunch spot. The total ascent is 275 meters and there are numerous great views along the way. Enjoy!

        Bear Bones Trail is a fun descent from the top of the Rose Valley trails to start a full lap of Rose Valley reservoir.  There are some steep and rocky sections, and a few features along the way. At the end you take a hard right down a short trail labeled Side Show Bob to get down to the service road. The last portion is pretty rough, but enjoyable.<br>

A few hundred yards up the service road connects you to the trail around the reservoir.

        Once you've worked your way through the tough ascent of Rose Valley, this is a gentle respite around the backside of the peak connecting you to your downhill run. You'll get a welcome break from the tough climbs, and this trail features much gentler slopes and a little bit of rolling terrain. <br>

You can also look for the trailhead of Bear Bones to start a longer hike around the reservoir.

        The Thompson Pack Trail is a 4.7 km (one-way) trail that parallels and meanders along Sullivan Creek. This trail takes you through beautiful cedar-hemlock forests that boast an abundant and diverse population of fungi. <br>
<br>
This mainly shaded trail provides hikers with relief from the sun, making this a wonderful summer hike. This trail was originally built to transport supply up to the Thompson Forestry Lookout Tower. This tower was used seasonally and was used as a fire lookout. <br>
<br>
Due to it's proximity to town and great singletrack, this trail provides excellent opportunity for hiking, horse-back riding, or trail running. This trail is also open to mountain bikers.

        Swamp Donkey is a great climb that takes hikers out of the reservoir area, and leads to many of the more popular parking areas. A series of about 30 well built switchbacks gets you out of the lowest sections.<br>
<br>
Once you've climbed your way out of the depression that the reservoir sits in, you'll be treated to a gentle ascent that leads to the top of West Kelowna Rd. If you parked at the elementary school nearby, take the trail that breaks south (right). You end up at a rolling singletrack heading all the way back to the elementary school, which is a fun way to end a hike.

Take the <a href=""/mobile-app"">Hiking Project mobile app</a> as these trails are not marked well yet, and there are lots of choices in Rose Valley.

The easily followed path climbs, sometimes steeply, along Evans Creek to reach Emerald Lake camp. After passing Emerald Lake on the north side, continue following the path to Cahill Lake where the camp is now located at the far end. The trail reaches the Cahill Lake campground by skirting the lake on the south side before reaching a signed intersection for the campground (right, crossing the creek) or Beatrice Lake (left, onward uphill). Beatrice Lake is a few kilometers further with a final steep portion just before reaching the large lake. There is a lunch area but no camping area at Beatrice.

An info board at the eastern side explains the history of this lake: Logger's Lake sits inside a volcanic crater, the cone of which rose up through glacial ice 10,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, it created the columns of basalt rock outcroppings that you can still see on the hillsides above the lake.

After the initial push through 300-400m of elevation, there is a section of granite slabs and fallen trees to navigate.

<br>
The top of Mt Thompson burnt in the early 1900's and some of the old fir and pine snags are still standing.  The trail also passes through a small alpine meadow just above a rocky outcrop that was used as a hang-gliding launching point in the 1980's.

        The trail starts from the Takakkaw Falls parking area and heads north along a wide, very well-made trail. The trail will narrow as you progress. <br>
<br>
Along the way, there are a few short side trails to a few waterfalls that are well worth the extra trip, but these trails can be much muddier than the main trail. <br>
<br>
Eventually, the trail becomes singletrack and gets a little steeper, but it never gets too step. The trail ends at the base of Laughing Falls which is very impressive. Return back to the trailhead where you can quickly take the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7026031/takakkaw-falls-trail"">Takakkaw Falls Trail</a>,  too.

        The Simpson River parking area is easy to find on the east side of the Banff-Windermere Highway (aka BC 93) about 57 km northeast of Radium Hot Springs and 46 km south of Trans-Canadian Highway. The parking area and bridge offer great views of the Kootenay River and valley for those just looking for a quick, scenic stop. Anyone who ventures farther will be rewarded with excellent views through the open meadow - the result of a forest fire in 2001. <br>
<br>
Head across the bridge and through the meadow along the clear trail. The overgrown grasses along the trail mean that your lower half could get extremely wet from early morning dew. However, the Kootenay/Simpson Valley is well worth wet feet as nearly the entire 8.8 km of the trail is a casual stroll with mountain views in every direction. The elevation gain is barely noticeable for most of the way, although there are a few spots made steeper by erosion. <br>
<br>
The trail initially heads south along the Kootenay River before turning east to follow the Simpson River. At this point, a tiny bluff offers great views to the south over Simpson River. The trail levels out again and heads southeast. A few muddy areas have ""boardwalks"" made of felled trees to ease the going. From these, you'll be elevated above the meadow/new growth so take the opportunity to soak in the views and look for wildlife. <br>
<br>
A little over a mile and a half into the trip, you'll pass through a small cluster of trees that survived the fire. After that, the trail turns straight east. A few places near the cliff down to the river offer excellent views to the mountains of Assiniboine Provincial Park. Slightly past three miles, the trail crosses a small brook that flows down a boulder field. There is a bridge made of a large tree, but you can probably cross the creek without it. <br>
<br>
The last mile and a half of the trail follows closely to Simpson River. The trail ""ends"" at the border of Assiniboine Provincial Park, but you can continue into the park if you are planning on backpacking and have a permit. Otherwise, you'll have to head back to the parking area.

        The skyline trail is now part of the TransCanada Trail network, and in places signage has been replaced with TCT trail markers.  The <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7080565/skyline-trail"">Skyline Trail</a> signs still exist, especially through the middle part of the trail.  There are many entry points to the trail, I've mapped this from the first point that the power lines and trail enter residential areas in West Vancouver at Millstream Road. <br>
<br>
The trail is co-branded TCT and Baden Powell at this point, and climbs quickly to the intersection with <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005039/brothers-creek-fire-road"">Brothers Creek Fire Road</a>.  An alternative approach to reach <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7080565/skyline-trail"">Skyline Trail</a> would be to enter at the Millstream entrance for the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005039/brothers-creek-fire-road"">Brothers Creek Fire Road</a>.  From here, the trail markers for <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7080565/skyline-trail"">Skyline Trail</a> are also visible. So, as long as you see one of the three trail names (BP, Skyline or TCT) you are on the right path.  <br>
<br>
The route rises further through the lower Hollyburn, eventually reaching the Helipad at <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005042/brothers-creek-trail"">Brothers Creek Trail</a>.  From here, the Baden Powell trail turns off and climbs the hill while <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7080565/skyline-trail"">Skyline Trail</a> continues to follow the power lines.  The trail starts to flatten out for a short period, but the trail climbs and descends slightly at each of the many creek and gully crossings.  <br>
<br>
As the trail nears Cypress Mountain the path stays in the power line right of way and becomes easier.  The end point of the trail is a nice viewpoint and picnic area about halfway up the drive to Cypress Bowl.

        After circling the east side of Kaslo Lake, one passes the large Kokanee Glacier Hut where a sign points to the trail that accesses Sapphire Lakes. The trail climbs moderately to a Enterprise pass and another fork to Tanal Lake and the Enterprise Creek watershed. Good views towards Kaslo Lake reward the hiker but are soon lost as one presses higher toward Saphire Lakes. <br>
<br>
Once out of treeline, several minor lakes appear on the right (north) of the trail which passes through giant alpine meadows before reaching the first of the Sapphire Lakes. There is an outhouse at the lower Sapphire Lake but no camping is permitted. Following the trail onward from the first lake, one will reach the second, higher, lake in a matter of minutes.

This is a great easier, rolling downhill trail from the top of Rose Valley to your vehicle parked at the elementary school.

        The east end of Canyon Creek Trail starts at a small parking area at the end of Canyon Creek Road in Nicholson, BC, just south of Golden, BC on Hwy 95. From the parking area, facing west into the woods, one can hear Canyon Creek to the left and there is a wide path to it—this is NOT the trail. Facing straight ahead there is a wide dirt scar up a very steep hill—this is NOT the trail. Between these two wide paths, close to the wide scar going straight up, on its left is a narrow path—this IS the trail.<br>
<br>
The trail starts by going up VERY steeply.  But this is not as bad as it seems. The steep section is short and fixed ropes are there to assist in climbing it. After reaching the top of the steep section, the trail bends right and climbs gradually in the woods. Up here, the trail is on a canyon rim with  Canyon Creek on the left (south), far below, at the canyon bottom, for the rest of this hike.<br>
<br>
The first of many canyon overlook viewpoints, is reached almost immediately, at the 0.3 mile mark. From here on, the trail continues climbing gradually along the rim's edge, sometimes in the woods, and sometimes right at the edge with open views of the canyon, surrounding mountains, and countryside. A few side trails come in on the right—stay left to continue on Canyon Creek Trail. A small bridged creek, Tallis Creek, is passed at the 0.9 mile mark.<br>
<br>
Eventually, at about the 1.8 mile mark, Canyon Creek Trail starts heading south, and after a few turns, it seems to be in the woods for good. But it pops out one last time for open canyon views at about the 2.2 mile mark, and then goes back into the woods permanently. <br>
<br>
Continuing on from this last viewpoint, the trail does keep going for another 0.8 miles to where it then ends at a dirt road. But this last stretch is narrow, with nothing much to see. The park map notes that the trail gets progressively more challenging and you may encounter mountain bikers after the last viewpoint. Being narrow and more challenging, for safety reasons, please leave this last stretch for the mountain bikers who diligently maintain this trail system.

Once on the trail proper, the first 15 minutes are a gruelling steep hike up a not very well marked path.

On reaching the cabin, take the signed trail to the ""toe of the glacier"" and proceed to climb. As the trail braids and fades in and out on the scree, keep to the east side of the creek and glacier ""toe"", west side of the large rock outcropping called the Battleship. There is no climbing involved if one approaches the summit from the top of the glacier but any other approach seems extremely steep and inaccessible.

        The one-way Alpine Loop acts as a nice warm-up or short loop from the Blackcomb or Peak 2 Peak Gondolas. Visitors will find an easy gravel path that connects to the extended network of trails. The views are good, though not as good as those found further ahead. If you're only hiking this loop, consider adding in the short but rougher Fitzsimmons Loop.

        The trail climbs quite gradually at first through the alpine forest. As it nears its terminus, the trail becomes quite steep and you may need to look quite closely for the trail markers early in the season.  Additionally, there are a couple of short scrambles to reach the peak. The peak itself offers beautiful views over the city and the Lions as a reward. <br>

The trail is well used during the summer for hikers, and you'll likely meet a number of people on the trail on nice days.

        Coleman Glacier Trail starts at a marked trail junction at the edge of the forest on the gravel flats of the Smoky River, along <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7055371/moose-river-route-smoky-river-crossing-to-moose-pass"">Moose River Route: Smoky River Crossing to Moose Pass</a>. Go southeast at this trail junction to hike to views of Coleman Glacier.<br>
<br>
From the trail junction, Coleman Glacier Trail enters the fir forest with its dense undergrowth. The trail climbs through the forest as it follows Yates Torrent upstream for the first 1.6 miles. Yates Torrent is to the right (southwest) of the trail, and below the trail in a canyon along this stretch. There are a few lookouts where the trail comes close to the edge of the canyon and Yates Torrent can be seen, but otherwise it is only heard. <br>
<br>
After 1.6 miles, Yates Torrent jogs southwest away from Coleman Glacier Trail, and can no longer be heard. The trail continues in the forest to about the 2.0 mile mark. Although most of these first 2.0 miles are in the forest, there are a few small stretches that break out of the forest and it's easy to lose the trail in these small meadows. Watch carefully to see where it reappears.<br>
<br>
At the 2.0 mile mark, the trail reaches a small meadow on the west side of a little glacial lake, and disappears. Cross the meadow, keeping to the right, and pick up trail on the west (right) side of the little lake. Follow this trail to the lake's outlet stream, cross the outlet stream and look for cairns. Follow these cairns over the rocky area here at the end of the lake to find the trail as it reenters the forest.<br>
<br>
After the trail reenters the forest, there is visible trail all the way to close to the Coleman Glacier moraine. The trees eventually thin as the trail climbs toward the rocky moraine. The visible trail ends at the base of a rocky ridge (the moraine) to the right. <br>
<br>
Remembering where the visible trail ended, climb to the top of the moraine and continue hiking up its crest to get better and better views of Coleman Glacier and Yates Torrent as it cascades down from the glacier with glacial melt waters into a little glacial lake, and then down towards its canyon and the Smoky River. The barren cliffs of Chetang Ridge are across Yates Torrent. In the distance, on the right, Chetang Ridge joins Tatei Ridge at Titkana Peak that forms the north side of Snowbird Pass, a gap in the mountains to the right. Lynx Mountain, farther in the distance, on the right, is the south side of Snowbird Pass. Reef Icefield is behind Coleman Glacier and the glacier flows down from this icefield.

<br>
Enjoy some nice views of the river and surrounding mountains as you climb up the valley. At the top of the valley, you'll find an Alpine Club of Canada hut, the Stanley Mitchell Hut.

        To find Overlander Falls Trail, from the Mt. Robson Provincial Park Visitor Center, cross the highway and hike up the road that goes to the campground. Continue on this road, past the campground, to where the road crosses the Fraser River. The trailhead is on the left (east) side of the road, just before the bridge over the Fraser River.<br>
<br>
Overlander Falls Trail immediately enters the woods, which are primarily pine trees with dense undergrowth. The Fraser River is nearby to the right of the trail and can easily be heard. The trail follows the Fraser River up to Overlander Falls.  There are great views of the river and the mountains through the trees. Sections of the river are narrower with high canyon-like walls, and other sections are wider with less dramatic shores. Regardless, the river is always there and beautiful with its cascades and turquoise color from its glacier-fed sources.<br>
<br>
After 1.5 miles, the Overlander Falls viewpoint is reached. Overlander Falls is named for a large party from Ontario that courageously traveled overland to British Columbia in 1862, a time when people typically went to British Columbia by boat around South America. This party became known as the Overlanders and passed by here.

        You can access this trail from the top of West Kelowna Rd or as part of the larger network of trails in Rose Valley Park.  <br>
<br>
From the top of West Kelowna Rd, enter the park and follow the service road for 100 meters and take the north fork. Before the next steep climb (you'll see it), take a left and in 50 meters look for the singletrack on your right and it starts your switchbacks. <br>
<br>
Your work is rewarded at the top with some great views of the Okanagan Valley and some rolling singletrack down to Rose Valley Lake.

        This steep trail will climb through the forest until you reach the alpine, where the terrain opens up and you can see the Train Glacier. There are three main lakes that make a scenic stopping point for you to find some flat ground to put your tent. <br>
<br>
From here, it's possible to continue on to a number of off-trail routes and scrambles to surrounding peaks, with Locomotive Mountain being the shortest and most straightforward of the available routes.

        From the junction with the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7056659/lower-ridge"">Lower Ridge</a> Trail, the Crater Rim Trail turns west through scrubby brush and crosses a small scree slope. Start up the ridgeline where the steepness increases and the surface is rooty and rocky. This surreal, moss-covered hillside is otherworldly and the breezes refreshing. Steep switchbacks and the increasingly skinny path keep you alert and keep the heart pumping. Peek-a-boo views improve the further you go.  <br>
<br>
Soon, the gradient eases considerably along the top of the hill and the forest opens up into a pleasant wooded landscape. Trend downhill off the nose of the ridge heading south. At a signed trail junction, stay on the Crater Rim Trail that contours along the flank of the hillside eventually reaching the eastern shore of Loggers Lake.  <br>
<br>
As the info board next to the lake explains: Logger's Lake sits inside a volcanic crater, the cone of which rose up through glacial ice 10,000 years ago. As the lava cooled, it created the columns of basalt rock outcroppings that you can still see on the hillsides above the lake.

At the top of the hill, the trail becomes a lovely rolling trail with soft footing and many roots.  A real joy to hike on.

        Moose River Route in its entirety (about 40 miles) goes from a trailhead about 25 miles east of the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> trailhead, on the Yellowhead Highway (Hwy 16), to <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> at the British Columbia/Alberta border. However, this trail description is only about the Moose River Route section from the end of <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> to the Smoky River crossing. A great out-and-back day hike from any of the Berg Lake area trail camps, is to hike down <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> and Moose River Route to the Smoky River, and back.<br>
<br>
Moose River Route begins where <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> ends at Robson Pass on the Continental Divide and Alberta/British Columbia border. This point is well marked with a big trail sign and boundary marker.<br>
<br>
Upon entering Alberta, Moose River Route continues through the beautiful, open countryside of the Berg Lake Valley. However, it is now really the Adolphus Lake Valley. The trail is flat here. High peaks rise to the left of the trail, and across the valley to the right of the trail. Blue/green Adolphus Lake is soon reached about 0.3 miles from the trail start. The trail follows the lake's shore for a short ways and then leaves the shoreline. <br>
<br>
Soon, in the distance, the Calumet Ridge can be seen. At the outlet of Adolphus Lake, the outlet creek is the start of Smoky River, whose waters will eventually reach the Arctic Ocean. Leaving Adolphus Lake behind, the trail continues through the flat valley, with the Smoky River meandering across the meadows, to the right of the trail.<br>
<br>
After about 2.7 miles, Moose River Route begins to slowly descend. A trail junction with Jasper National Park's North Boundary Trail is reached about 3.3 miles from the Moose River Route trailhead. Watch for a sign that marks this junction and go right to follow Moose River Route. Moose River Route descends to arrive at the Smoky River, now much larger, having collected waters of the glacial Yates Torrent. This can be a daunting place to cross the Smoky River (see Note below), although Moose River Route continues on the other side of the Smoky River as described by <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7055371/moose-river-route-smoky-river-crossing-to-moose-pass"">Moose River Route: Smoky River Crossing to Moose Pass</a>.<br>
<br>
Note: The Yates Torrent bridge over the Smoky River is out. There is a flagged hikers crossing along <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7055371/moose-river-route-smoky-river-crossing-to-moose-pass"">Moose River Route: Smoky River Crossing to Moose Pass</a>. Additionally, the water level is lower a short ways downstream where the river is more spread out on the gravel flats, making for an easier ford as described in <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7055372/moose-river-route-smoky-river-crossing-alternate"">Moose River Route: Smoky River Crossing Alternate</a>

As one travels along the road, it becomes rougher and rockier, so best to have a high clearance vehicle. Further travel encounters occasional washouts, although construction work is being done to fix these washouts. However, as of September 2018, 4-wheel drive was needed past the 17.7-mile mark, along with patience and effort to fill in washouts that even 4 wheel drive could not handle. Therefore, this is a hiking trail past where one's vehicle can safely make it in and back out.<br>

<br>
There are lots of man-made and natural jumps that are fun to hike up and down. Watch for roots, rocks, etc. Also take some time to look around. It's a beautiful part of the area with old growth trees and lots of greenery. The energy is great on this trail.

        Starting from Ambleside, the trail begins behind the Park Royal Mall.  It follows the river for about 500m, passing under bridges and behind buildings.  The trail then climbs a flight of stairs and a reasonably steep hill.  At the top of the hill, turn right and follow the road to the highway underpass.  From here the trail follows a gravel road for about 1.5km before entering the Capilano Trail network just north of the service entrance to the Capilano Suspension Bridge.  The trail then continues as singletrack - see <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7004838/capilano-pacific-trail-north"">Capilano Pacific Trail (North)</a>.

        This is the 1st half of the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039808/baden-powell-trail"">Baden Powell Trail</a>, a point to point trail beginning in Horseshoe Bay and ending in Deep Cove in North Vancouver. The first half of the trail features the high point, at the top of Black Mountain.  The end of the West Vancouver portion of the trail is Cleveland Dam, which is the natural crossing point from West Vancouver to North Vancouver.  <br>
<br>
The trailhead for the Baden Powell is by the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal, so many hikers will choose to start at the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7006577/whyte-lake-trail"">Whyte Lake Trail</a>, which has better parking, and connects to the Baden Powell about a kilometre in.  <br>
<br>
The trail climbs steadily to Eagle Bluffs at the 6km mark, then to Black Mountain around 9 kilometres.  The Baden Powell actually loops beneath the Black Mountain summit, but if you have covered all the distance (and elevation) it is recommended that you take the extra few steps to reach the summit.  From the summit, the trail descends quickly into the Cypress ski area, and the ski trails and lifts will be visible.  Take a minute to fill your water bottles at the summit, then climb back up the side of Hollyburn Mountain before a steep descent through the cross-country ski area and the famous Hollyburn chute. <br>
<br>
At the bottom of the hill, you'll join the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005054/skyline-trail"">Skyline Trail</a> at the powerlines.  There are a few tricky navigation sections here, as the trail is alternately marked <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7005054/skyline-trail"">Skyline Trail</a>, TCT (Trans-Canada Trail) and <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039808/baden-powell-trail"">Baden Powell Trail</a>.  As long as you are on one of these you'll be fine, and will come out into the British Properties before crossing three roads, and descending along the power line right of way to the Cleveland Dam.

        To get to this trail, you'll have to take <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7026119/emerald-lake-trail"">Emerald Lake Trail</a> to the northwest corner. From there, the Emerald Basin Trail starts off flat and very straight. Eventually, it turns northwest and gains elevation very quickly. It is steep but does not require any scrambling. From where you begin to gain elevation to where the valley opens up, the trail is in dense forest so be mindful of bears. <br>
<br>
Eventually, the trail exits the forest and the views open up! You'll hike along the creek draining the valley until you come to a rock field. Explore to your hearts content while enjoying the amazing views of the President, Vice President, Wapta Mt, Mt Stephan, and Burgess.

        This trail starts at the Emerald Lake parking area and goes around the lake in either direction. If you start near the boat house and bathrooms, the trail is paved and great for families or those with limited mobility. <br>
<br>
There are a number of benches along the western edge while it is paved as well. The southern and eastern side of the trail is still in excellent condition and great for the family, but is singletrack and dirt. The northern edge is wide and gravel. <br>
<br>
The lake is visible from almost the entire trail. Emerald Lake is really beautiful and a deeper green than some of the other milky-blue lakes in the region. When it is smooth, the lake offers wonderful reflections of the stunning mountains around it.

        The first part of the trail is a 1km crossing of Buttle Lake from the Augerpoint Trailhead parking lot. Try and time your crossing either before noon or after 5PM to avoid the high afternoon winds.<br>
<br>
The trail starts at the Philips Ridge Marine Campsite and ascends gently at the start through a gorgeous mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. It is well graded and very easy to follow and is characterized by an enormous number of switchbacks in order to make the 1270m elevation gain more palatable. There are some large Douglas-Firs and Hemlocks at the lower elevations with Yellow Cedars frequenting the higher elevations.<br>
<br>
Trail is a mix of gravel, loam, dirt, loose rock and bluffy rocks with some mild exposure near the top.<br>
<br>
The end of the trail crests the ridge and opens up into a wonderful hillocky meadow with many tarns and different sized lakes.The last quarter of the trail is in the open alpine zone with stunning views back down to the lake and the eastern Strathcona peaks across the valley. <br>
<br>
Fast travelers have completed the trail in 3-4 hours while mere humans usually take 5-6 hrs.<br>
The Marble Meadows trail extracts a heavy toll in the many switchbacks to get to the alpine zone, but the rewards are stunning including alpine peaks, geological interest, and fossil deposits.<br>
<br>
If you're looking to head deeper into the backcountry, this trail continues further west, contouring around the multiple alpine lakes in this lofty area.

        This trail starts at Dempsey Road. Follow the path as it winds its way down past the 30 Ft Pool, and to the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/gem/1001/lynn-canyon-suspension-bridge"">Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge</a> and Falls. Once at the bridge, take a left on to the bridge. After you have crossed it, you'll take a right and follow the trail. Eventually, you'll pass a bridge (on the right), and Twin Falls. After this, take a left and follow the trail to Lillooet Rd. Here the trail crosses the road and continues to the east.<br>
<br>
The next section of the Baden Powell trail is multi-use and open to bikes. It does it's job connecting a number of descending trails and climbing trails to allow hikers to move across the mountain. Note that past the Power Line to Baden Powell Connector the trail is closed to bikers.<br>
<br>
On the eastern end of the trail, hiker will encounter a 2k section to Quarry Rock that is nearly always quite busy with hikers heading to the viewpoint. This portion of the trail is wider and allows passing, though it can still be challenging at the busiest times. <br>
<br>
From the top of Quarry Rock, the trail is technical, fun, rolling. The 200m of elevation gain comes relatively easy given the gentle grade.<br>
<br>
One other suggestion I would make is that there is a very big/nice parking lot further up (north) on Lillooet Rd., with a big map board and easy access to the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/gem/1001/lynn-canyon-suspension-bridge"">Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge</a>.<br>
<br>
On the Hiking Project site, in satellite mode, the big parking lot shows up as does the trail leading down to the suspension bridge and the Lillooet Rd Trail leading back out to the easy trail/path along the road. In satellite mode, you can just barely see the small parking area (it's head-in parking right off the road).

The path will now head west.  <br>
<br>
From here you'll pass scenic Siwash rock which marks the change to a southern direction.  You'll soon pass Third Beach and the Stanley Park Teahouse.  The path ends at Second Beach.

        The Sherbrooke Lake Trailhead is at a small parking area next to a lodge on the TransCan (Hwy 1). It is easily accessible when going west on the TransCan and is marked with a small sign. When going east on the TransCan, make a U-turn at the lodge to go west on the TransCan to find the parking area and trailhead.<br>
<br>
Sherbrooke Lake Trail begins by climbing through a fir forest for the first 0.8 miles. As the trail climbs, views of Cathedral Mountain to the south emerge through the trees. About 0.9 miles from the trailhead, a junction with <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039301/paget-lookout-trail"">Paget Lookout Trail</a> is passed. Continue straight at this junction to follow Sherbrooke Lake Trail. This is well marked.<br>
<br>
After passing the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039301/paget-lookout-trail"">Paget Lookout Trail</a> junction, Sherbrooke Lake Trail levels out and the trees thin. A few small meadows are passed, and one arrives at Sherbrooke Lake after hiking 1.9 miles from the trailhead. Sherbrooke Lake is a beautiful, turquoise mountain lake surrounded by peaks. Across the lake to the west is Mt. Ogden. Cathedral Mountain, across the hidden Kicking Horse River Valley, can be seen at the south end of the lake. North of the lake is Mt. Niles in the distance.<br>
<br>
The Sherbrooke Lake Trail then continues by following the lakeshore for another 0.9 miles. The trail then reaches the lake's input streams and ends.

        This trail is a popular scenic loop which takes you up the mountain, but not too far up to be a major climb, through Douglas fir and western cedars.  It then drops back down via many stairs and flattens out along Lynn Creek.<br>
<br>
Starting at the south end of the loop, head up the mountain.  You'll first climb some switchbacks before the trail turns north.  At this point, the trail will straighten but continue to climb.  <br>
<br>
After some time, the trail will start down and soon begin many switchbacks and stairs.  At the base you'll come to an intersection, turn left and follow the trail along the river back to the start.

        After leaving the logging road, this trail heads through a clear-cut that has partially destroyed some of the trail with debris. It is possible to still follow the trail markers, but time can be saved by cutting across the clear-cut to the rest of the well-marked trail through the forest. The trail crosses Whispering Creek shortly after you enter the forest, and this is a good spot to re-fill water. It is then a steep trek up to the peak. The best views to be had are approximately 30 minutes before you reach the peak.

The fun will eventually finish, and the trail rejoins the paved LSCR trailway. Watch for bikes as you cross.

        This is an easy part of the trail to hike. It is steep at the start (near the houses) and continually builds but at an easier incline towards 256 Street. There are a few twists and turns. Make sure you watch for roots and rocks. The last km is pretty easy with a slight downhill towards 256. Make sure you have a bear bell in bear season. I've personally seen bears up on this trail. They are mainly black bears so you shouldn't get in trouble if you're smart (don't try to get close no matter how cute their cubs are!!!)

Most hikers park at the Dewdney trailhead (finish), and utilize a shuttle to the Nancy Greene Pass trailhead (start).<br>
<br>
The trail starts with a long climb to the summit of Mt Elgood, which is a test of pacing and stamina. The next undulating section through the alpine is the most scenic. Unnecessary Ridge is a long, and in places very rough descent to Gibbards Junction. Another big climb up Mt Kirkup and a descent from Grey Mountain gets you to Red Mountain Ski Resort and the only reasonable option for a bailout (via South-side road). <br>
<br>
Another climb onto White Wolf Ridge, a short descent then another climb gets you to the top of Record Ridge. From here it's still a long way, but mostly descending. Lots of strenuous hiking and a unique grasslands section get you to the top of the Dewdney Trail. From here, you can make your way back to Rossland on the Old Cascade Hwy, but most will choose to descend the Dewdney Trail to their waiting vehicle and well-deserved cold beers.

        This is what I call the ""pay off"" when hiking up the back side of the mountain. First there are many trails to choose from as the mountain bikers have carved out a lot of interesting trails. You do have to watch for rocks, roots, and debris. <br>
<br>
The trails are very popular, and you can see horse riders, hikers, runners and mountain bikers out here all in one day.  Everyone so far has been very friendly and respectful of each other. Also there are many natural and man-made jumps which are fun to hike over (however I never get any ""air,"" just fall back to earth like a rock!)<br>
<br>
At the bottom, you pop out of the forest onto a plateau where, on a clear day, you can see the Fraser River and also the city of Maple Ridge. After that, it's just a stream crossing, some loose rocks and you meet up with the main <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7013025/bear-ridge"">Bear Ridge</a> trail again.

<br>
This trail starts with the Smoky River ford that can range from easy when the water is low - ankle to calf deep, to treacherous with high water levels such as waist level or possibly higher. Water levels are usually lower by the end of August when the winter snow melt has subsided. However, even then, they will typically be lower in the morning and higher in the afternoon due to glacier melt during the day. Water levels are also higher after rains. Regardless of water level, the current is swift. Best to use trekking poles when crossing such fast flowing water.</div>",https://cdn2.apstatic.com/photos/hike/7051676_medium_1555693363.jpg

The route consists of a steep trail with many switchbacks that roughly follows beside Eaton Creek. The trail will cross the creek a few times over sturdy bridges.

        The trail starts with an immediate steep climb (about 1,200 feet in the first mile) over many slick tree roots. Around a mile or so, it'll flat occasionally, and you'll cross a marshy area on a nice wooden ""sidewalk."" <br>
<br>
A little further on, the forest suddenly opens to a beautiful meadow with a very pleasant corridor through the middle that parallels, and at times crosses, the flowing river. The trail will continue to slowly climb as the terrain becomes more rocky and will eventually become steep again as you reach the glacier and the top of Brandywine Mountain.

        Paget Lookout Trail starts from the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039296/sherbrooke-lake-trail"">Sherbrooke Lake Trail</a>. Therefore, to get to Paget Lookout Trail, find the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039296/sherbrooke-lake-trail"">Sherbrooke Lake Trail</a> trailhead at a small parking area next to a lodge on the TransCan (Hwy 1). It is easily accessible when going west on the TransCan and is marked with a small sign. When going east on the TransCan, make a U-turn at the lodge to go west on the TransCan to find the parking area and trailhead. <br>
<br>
Hike up <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039296/sherbrooke-lake-trail"">Sherbrooke Lake Trail</a> for about 0.9 miles to a trail junction where Paget Lookout Trail starts. Go right at this junction to go to Paget Lookout. This is well marked by a sign. <br>
<br>
The beginning of Paget Lookout Trail is fairly level as it travels through the fir forest. After about a quarter of a mile, the trail begins to climb. It continues climbing until it reaches Paget Lookout at the trail's end. <br>
<br>
After the first quarter mile, Paget Lookout Trail veers left to head northwest, climbing on a long traverse for the next 0.75 miles. As the trail climbs, the Kicking Horse River Valley comes into view to the southwest. The trail then switchbacks and heads southeast for about a quarter mile to a wonderful viewpoint of the Kicking Horse River Valley; Field, BC; and mountains that go on forever into the distance. Turquoise Wapta Lake along the TransCan can be seen far below at the mouth of the Cataract Valley and O'Hara area.<br>
<br>
The trail then does a couple more short switchbacks and arrives at the old Paget Lookout, a fire lookout last used in the late 1970s. The views from here are awesome! Rocks at the side of the lookout building are a great place for lunch. <br>
<br>
From the lookout:<br>
<ul><li>The Kicking Horse River Valley is to the southwest. The TransCan (Hwy 1) and trains run down it. Field, BC and snowy peaks can be seen in the distance.</li><li>The Cataract Valley and O'Hara area, a popular hiking area, are to the south, across the TransCan and behind Lake Wapta.</li><li>To the east, across the continental divide, is the Bow River Valley. Behind the Bow River Valley is the Slate Mountain Range in Alberta's Banff National Park.</li><li>Paget Peak is to the north. This lookout is on the south side of Paget Peak.</li>

        Hargreaves Lake Route is great for day trips if you are staying at one of the trail camps in the Berg Lake area. It can be combined with <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039405/mumm-basin-route"">Mumm Basin Route</a> to make a wonderful loop from the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a>. The Hargreaves Lake Route trailhead is on the <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7038998/berg-lake-trail"">Berg Lake Trail</a> close to the Marmot Trail Camp. This is marked by a sign. <br>
<br>
The Hargreaves Lake Route starts off in a fir forest as it immediately begins climbing. Very shortly, after about a quarter mile, it emerges from the trees, onto a rocky hillside, as it continues to climb. The views are great, and get more and more expansive as the trail climbs. Mt. Robson, with its Berg Glacier and Mist Glacier flowing into beautiful, turquoise Berg Lake, take center stage.<br>
<br>
About 0.8 miles from its trailhead, Hargreaves Lake Route reaches a turnoff to <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039403/hargreaves-lake-and-glacier-viewpoint-spur"">Hargreaves Lake and Glacier Viewpoint Spur</a>. This short 0.1 mile spur is well worth taking. It switchbacks up over rock and gravel to a ridge top where Hargreaves Lake and Hargreaves Glacier can be seen.<br>
<br>
After passing <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039403/hargreaves-lake-and-glacier-viewpoint-spur"">Hargreaves Lake and Glacier Viewpoint Spur</a>, Hargreaves Lake Route heads northeast, as it continues to climb over rock for about another 0.2 miles, to where it reaches its high point. From here, the trail descends very gradually. As it descends, it enters sparsely forested terrain. Looking past the trees, the views are still very good.<br>
<br>
Hargreaves Lake Route reaches a trail junction about 1.8 miles from its trailhead. Here, Hargreaves Lake Route ends, as it meets <a href=""https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7039405/mumm-basin-route"">Mumm Basin Route</a> and Toboggan Falls Route.
