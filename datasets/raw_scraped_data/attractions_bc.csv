Thriving outdoors rain or shine, fishing the great white sturgeon, mountain bike trailblazing, hiking to the soundtrack of a rumbling waterfall and the call of the raven; we continue to learn from the Stó:lō peoples and Indigenous communities on the connection and significance of this land and how it has shaped important cultures and traditions. A growing city that values its diversity and community. Join us to #exploremission",< 1 hour

We offer two distinct tours: WAPTA FALLS WILD & SCENIC Today, we can travel these routes and imagine the hardships that must have been endured on these shorelines. mountain passes and trails. The result is one of the most unique tours in the Canadian Rockies, travelling historic trade route. This tour begins on the Beaver River and travels to the confluence of the Beaver and Kicking Horse Rivers. From there, in true Canadian fashion, participants engage in a short portage along one of the original portage routes of the Canadian West. Natives and explorers alike travelled these exact waterways and trails centuries ago. Highlights include paddling to the base of Wapta Falls, the Rockies most photographed waterfall. From there the trip continues down Class 1 Whitewater. Most of this tour occurs within Yoho National Parks, and at any point participants can glance up for sweeping views of Mount Chancellor, the Canadian Rockies peak over 10,000 feet that straddles the Western Flank of this world-renowned Mountain Range. The tour is 5 hours in length from start to finish, and departs daily at 10 AM The Wapta Falls Wild & Scenic Tour is offered Daily. With a maximum guide to participant ratio of 5:1, seating on this tour is very limited. Reservations are strongly recommended. PRICE = $129 PP CAD DOLLARS COLUMBIA VALLEY EXPLORER The Kicking Horse & Columbia River waterways through the town of Golden boast a historical significance to the Columbia area. With the stunning backdrop of Kicking Horse Mountain Resort and the the Purcell Mountain Range, this tour is shorter and more urban in nature than the Wild & Scenic Wapta Tour. We will see remnants of the old docks of a bygone area that were at one time a lifeline for the residents of golden to accessing goods. We will travel under the Kicking Horse Pedestrian Bridge, the longest covered timber bridge in Canada. Once we come to the terminus of the Kicking Horse River we will travel the Columbia River for a short while. This is a good time in the evening to catch a glimpse of black bears near the water's edge, although it is not guaranteed. With a guide ratio of 5:1 Reservations are strongly recommended.

The course began as 14 holes but quickly expanded to 18 in 1895. There have been at least three different lay-outs - the one played today was finalized in the mid-1920s (after a decision in 1923 to end the practice of hitting tee shots on two holes across the ever-busier Beach Drive). Our stately Clubhouse, completed in 1928, is a registered Canadian Historic Place and has undergone a number of expansions and renovations (including the most recent in 1993) and provides a grand and comfortable venue to begin your own memories. When you walk through this storied building you'll be reminded of a rich history of golf, companionship and community that spans over generations. Perhaps one of the more obscure yet heartwarming examples is a series of photos of a foursome on the course, taken annually on the same date over five decades. Golfing Legends For more than a century, famous names have graced our course, including golfing greats Harry Vardon, Byron Nelson, Joyce Wethered, Ben Hogan, Al Geiberger, Pat Bradley, George Knudson, Sam Snead, Dawn Coe Jones and Johnny Miller just to mention a few. Numerous celebrities, like Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Wayne Gretzky, Pamela Anderson and Kiefer Sutherland have also been drawn to the seaside links through the years, not only to play but also in support of charitable causes. History continues to be made in the annual Victoria and Seattle GC inter-club, a home and home friendly that is the oldest international golf tournament in North America (since 1895). The Seniors North West Championship, representing players of various levels from the U.S Pacific northwest, British Columbia and Alberta, continues to be hosted by VGC for eighty plus years now.",

Established in 1971, Eaglecrest is one of the oldest golf courses in the area. This 18 hole championship golf course offers lush fairways and towering evergreen trees. The layout deftly combines a variety of different elements to create a uniquely challenging course. The first three holes are traditional links-style holes, while the next nine are tighter, winding through dense groves of firs and cedars. The final six holes are the golf courses most formidable, especially the 14th and 17th. The par-5 14th hole features lakes on either side as well as a treacherous pot bunker guarding the large green. Eaglecrest Golf Club`s 17th is also tricky. With a narrow landing area, massive greenside bunkers, and a slippery, four tiered, narrow green, the 17th at Eaglecrest will test all areas of your game. Eaglecrest presents many challenging tests, even for the most seasoned golfer.",

Prior to 1988, Island Mountain Arts occasionally produced professional exhibitions by partnering with venues in Wells such as the Wells-Barkerville School, the Community Hall and the Wells Hotel, to exhibit artwork.

Designed in this tradition, SeaChange wooden gift boxes display a silk-screened Haida graphic by an internationally acclaimed Haida artist, Don Yeomans. The box contains a gold foil pouch of wild smoked sockeye salmon, which is truly an impressive gift presentation of Canadian smoked salmon. The salmon in this box has been cooked until moist and tender. It will last without refrigeration until opened and can simply be served with plain crackers! It is available in 113g – 4oz or 227g – 6oz or 454g – 16oz. Furthermore, smoked salmon pate is also available in gift boxes and is 100g per tin box or a pack of three in a cedar box. Traveling?

I have several friends in the fishing charter business that have top of the line fishing boats! Tofino has great fishing all year round, however June, July, August and September are the best times to come and catch Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, the occasional sockeye, halibut, lingcod and a variety of other bottom fish. I have to say, the guides I know just happen to be the best Tofino fishing guides Tofino has to offer. They are dialed into catching salmon and halibut, as well as having crab trap sets to pull to finish off the day!",

Most settlers abandoned the area over the years, but Ronning continued making his life here into the early 1960's, working as a trapper, fisherman, and camp cook, while maintaining his prized garden. During the earliest years, Bernt Ronning cleared over five acres of rainforest in order to plant the wilderness garden of his dreams. A garden created from seeds, cuttings of trees, and exotic plants he ordered from around the world. As the years passed, the garden continued to grow in size and variety. In the late 60's and into the 70's the garden nearly disappeared under the encroaching brush and alders. Many of the trees grew into unusual shapes as they struggled to find their way to the light. The daffodils stopped blooming under a thick canopy of dense salmon berry bushes. Most of the hundreds of flowers in the terraced beds were lost. Today, the garden has once again been freed from the invading rainforest.",

We raise mainly Coho and Chinook salmon. Here is a generally what our year will look like and what you will see. We raise approx 100,000 salmon fry per year Late March April, May the ice is off generally off of our outside rearing ponds and you can view our larger fry before they make their journey to the ocean. All of our larger fry will generally leave by the end of May. June and July is generally a catch up on projects month and a time to get ready for adult egg and sperm collection. Chinook Broodstock (Adult Salmon used in hatchery breeding process) collection is generally the end of August. This year as in many years we will be collecting Chinook broodstock in the Upper Bulkley or The Little Bulkley in hopes that this stock will continue to spawn for many years to come. August, September, October, November will be our 27th consecutive year of running our data collection fence on Toboggan Creek. All fish entering Toboggan Creek will be counted and assessed as female, male and hatchery or wild. This data is extremely valuable to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in knowing River and Ocean survivals of Salmon and how many survive and return to spawn and carry on the species. It aids in setting commercial, sport and food fish limits as well as getting as better picture of the year to year eco system of our watersheds and oceans. This is an amazing time to visit the Hatchery, there are very large numbers of Coho in the creek all fighting for spots to lay their eggs. Coho Broodstock generally takes place in October right in Toboggan Creek. This stock is raised/enhanced for the purpose of our DFO fence data and has proved successful over the years. Decemeber, January and February we are still open but not much is going on. Our yearling fry will spend the winter outside in our rearing ponds under the ice, safe from predators. There are no small fish inside or large fish in the creek at this time. All of our next springs fry will be quietly tucked away in their eggs throughout the winter waiting to hatch in the spring. Unfortunately they cannot be viewed at this stage, they have to be left alone with no light, noise or vibrational shock of any kind which can seriously stunt their growth and or kill the eggs. You are welcome to come by anytime and use our walking trails along the creek and our day use picnic area. Hope to see you there.",

Their mission: to dismantle an old wooden church and bring it back to Okanagan Falls.The plan called for a controlled blast of four dynamite sticks inside the church in order to ""loosen the nails"". Odd as it may seem, the explosion spared the wood from damage during dismantling.Save for losing the steeple, the plan succeeded. Now the 103 year old wooden church stands proudly in its second home of Okanagan Falls and is still an operating United Church. In keeping with its rather remarkable history, the church has since withstood the threat of two major floods, including the disastrous burst of the Okanagan Falls Dam in the early 1950's.In naming our VQA wines ""Blasted Church"" we celebrate the ingenuity of the initiative to move the church and honor those pioneers for their vision.",

The 35-year-old (planted in 1980), eight-acre vineyard is located on the Golden Mile and blessed with a unique soil combination and a small lake located at the base of it. This terroir provides an ideal foundation for growing superior grapes and a longer growing season than many other Golden Mile vineyards. Beavers helped to create the small lake during their manipulation of earth and water. And early settlers’ search for gold led to the beavers’ vast contribution to the history of the nation; the then-booming fashion industry’s need for beaver felt and fur ultimately allowed settlers to thrive, formally establish the country, and choose the beaver as Canada’s national animal.

We are also our wonderful seasonal and part time employees who get us through the crazy times. WHAT Honest, single vineyard wines of time and place - priced for everyday consumption. WHERE Naramata Bench, Okanagan Valley British Columbia Canada. 1060 Poplar Grove Road. Lock & Worth Winery shares a tasting room with Poplar Grove Cheese. When you visit you can taste both our wines and Poplar Groves artisanal cheeses together. WHY We strongly believe that one should be able to drink high quality, single vineyard (non-commodity), small production wines that are priced reasonably from British Columbia. We plan to be around 20 years from now, not by becoming a large company but by creating a sustainable business within our community. For us part of that means making wines that always over deliver. HOW We spend all of our money on our wines, not our marketing. We eschew heavy bottles, advertising and fancy labels. In the winery we use old French Oak (not expensive) and have very little in the way of technology (still use basket presses). We are also not part of any marketing groups nor do we submit wines to award or trade shows - all of which cost money. Every penny we save goes toward the quality of our wines and to keeping their prices stable. We hope you enjoy.",< 1 hour

This means that our customers are locavores choosing to eat organically grown, in-season foods when they're at their peak nutritionally and taste the best. We grow every imaginable vegetable and fruit that can be grown in our region--greens, radishes, beets, carrots, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, artichoke, rhubarb, currants, raspberries, blueberries...and the list goes on and on. The availability of foods at our market varies throughout the season. We don't ever import produce so this means that we won't have tomatoes through the winter and sometimes due to unpredictable weather or pest damage some foods are in limited supply even when they'd normally be available. It's more important for us to remain true to our mission to solely provide local food than to compromise by importing food from other countries and continents. And, to our great happiness, an ever growing number of people in our area also wish to support a budding local food system. Our customers want to support their neighboring farms and provide lasting benefits to our society, economy and environment. Our farm is also open to the public during market hours. We believe in full transparency. Come and walk around our farm and see where your food comes from and how it's grown. There are no secrets here. Our vision is a food-secure community where every citizen has access to local food year-round. My family and fellow-farmers will work tirelessly to make this dream a reality! --Dan and Helen and everyone at The Local Harvest Market",1-2 hours
