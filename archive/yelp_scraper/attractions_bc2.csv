Stanley Park,4.5,Parks,"28,783",#1 of 402 things to do in Vancouver,background-image:url(https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/10/a6/09/9f/beautiful-view-of-stanley.jpg),"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">I went to the Stanley Park in the morning on 19 June 05 and spent a whole day there. It is the perfect place to escape from city life. There is a lot of greenery. There are also many people cycling, jogging, rollerblading or strolling along the seawall. The beaches and playground are also very popular with families with kids.  <br><br>Traveling round the park<br>*********************<br>I took the free shuttle bus which stop at different popular locations round the park. You can hop in and out at any of these stops. I remembered one of the shuttle bus driver (a lady with plaits) was very friendly and gave a very lively commentary about the attractions of each sight and stop. However, she was the only driver that gave commentary. The rest of the drivers in the other shuttle buses did not give any commentary at all. I really feel that her company should give her a salary raise for her passion in her job. =) I enjoy her commentary so much that I took her last shuttle round the park. The last service is around 6:30pm.   <br><br>Wildlife<br>******<br>The park is home to many wildlife too, ie racoons, hares, squirrels and geese. I took a stroll from the information counter taking the Brockton Point Trial walkway to the totem poles. Along the way I saw this wild black hare, a distance away from me. When I took out my camera to take a picture of it, it hopped towards me. I guess it did not want its picture taken...=( I spotted a racoon at Prospect Point. It loved the camera and would even posed for you to take pictures. =) But, please do not touch or feed these wild animals. <br><br>Main Interesting sights<br>*******************<br>Vancouver Aquarium- I will write a review of this in its page itself.<br><br>Prospect Point- Beautiful view of Lions Gate Bridge and the North/ West Vancouver's mountains with the English Bay.    <br><br>Girl in a wet suit- This is a statue of a girl sitting on a rock. The amusing thing I find is that the sea birds seems to like this statue very much... see my photo. <br><br>Totem Poles- Here you will find besides the totem poles, horde of tourists round the globe young and old, busy posing and taking pictures. What a sight! But, I think it is still worth to come here to appreciate Stanley Park's history, which is home to the First Nations. There is a small area next to the gift shop with explanations of the significance of the totem poles to the First Nations. In front of the totem poles, there are signage explaining the details of each totem poles. <br><br>Well, I feel that this park is a must visit for those who come to Vancouver. A very interesting and relaxing park indeed!</span></div>",2-3 hours

I took my 14 year old son with me.  For the first day I was very grateful to have a tail-guide as well as the lead-guide: I needed assistance to get up from the deep powder. Also happy to have the benefits of her experience in terms of managing the deep powder. I also enjoyed the pace of the day: plenty of skiing with the relaxing trip back up in the cat.

With the help of both the museum and archives staff I started by searching a 1938 phone book and I located his address. I then looked through some newspapers from the 1930's and found his name mentioned several times. I also looked through old high school annuals from 1939 and 1940 to see if I could locate information about my late mother who was born in 1924 and grew up here. Unfortunately back in the day, the students were not listed in these annuals in alphabetical order, so I could locate anything in the time I had. To finish, I decided to leave the museum and archives to drive over and see the house. The staff let me know that the street addresses were revised from 3 to 4 digit addresses some years ago, so before heading out they assisted me in finding the updated address. Soon after, I was in the historical townsite on Maple Avenue having a look at the house were my mother grew up. A fun activity on my first trip to Powell River!</span></div>",< 1 hour

The places makes you stop and appreciate the beauty of our world. There is camping along the river looks beautiful with incredibly clear water.  It takes 2 hours to get to by gravel road from Gordon Bay in Cowichan. We only used 2 wheel drive on our 4x4 truck but it was definitely rough. No service anywhere either so be prepared and fill up your gas in Cowichan or bring a jerry can. Worth the trip!</span></div>",

The last two years have been terrible. The park operators are rude and go out of their way to look for problems from families that are quiet and considerate. The rules are not enforced equally and you feel like you are camping on egg shells and constantly worried you are doing something wrong. The washroom staff cleaning the bathroom (at 11 am... when people are trying to shower and get on with their day) told my daughters they had to leave and were not polite at all. We expect better service and respect from our provincial park operators. We saw a ridiculous amount of staff...  this is a 44 site campground... not necessary. Sadly, we will NOT be going back! If you have dogs, don't bother going... not worth it, just more grounds for the staff to be all over you. Our dog slipped off his collar and we got a written warning! The staff waited outside my shower room for me to give me a lecture and the ticket. I wonder if the Park Operators have some sort of ticket quota? Anyways, definitely visit the area if you can, but unless you like being watched constantly, stay away from the campsite....</span></div>",

For 45 km NW from there, the range is rocky and lightly forested with lodgepole pine, breaking into high benchlands and large creek basins draining through benchland country via small canyons.<br>Beyond that the range's terrain is much more gentle, with high, meadowed ridges running east towards the Fraser Canyon between treed plateaus and small canyons, and a few large, barren domes running further north along the Fraser. The range is bounded on the north and west by a large and impressive benchland-and-hoodoo sand canyon similar to those along the range's east flank - that of Churn Creek, which is a provincial protected area. The historic Empire Valley Ranch is near the mouth of Churn Creek and is provincially protected for heritage and environmental reasons.

The actual petroglyphs are in a very small section and I thought they were excellent - the ones you could see anyway. What I found disappointing was that most of the rock face was covered in moss and debris so who knows what is covered up.

Depending on the time of year, June usually, you may see momma and perhaps her babies.</span></div>",

Walk up bar and taste. Our host was knowledgeable and had a good presence.  Reservations are recommended. You get a choice of 6 wines from a decently sized list and are able to go in the direction you choose. Which is nice.<br><br>The non-refundable $10 tasting fee is a bit high for what it is, stand up bar. I fully support tasting fee's and I think it has made the Okanogan wine experience much better, for most wineries it is refundable with a minimum purchase. With a  group of 4 I would rather pickup a couple bottles of Bartier Bro's and taste elsewhere. I would rather spend a bit more a get a better tasting experience somewhere like Black Hills.<br><br>We enjoyed most of the wines we tasted, and purchased a few bottles. A good sample, but would probably  skip this one next time as there are better value for money tastings.</span></div>",< 1 hour

This time we really appreciated the beautiful lake. We went with another couple who had kids as well. They couldn’t get us sites together as pre arranged so they put us in site 45 which is overlooking the lake and is right by the dock. That made our trip and I’d like to say thank you to Lauren for that! What an amazing lake. The lake is high right now and a beautiful colour. We enjoyed the fishing and the paddle boarding (plus kayak rental). We floated down the river, under the logging bridge and up to some rapids. Beautiful scenery. The campground is small but cozy. The trains that come along, not a problem. A person gets used to the whistle and it’s neat to see a train go along beside the river and lake. You won’t want to leave the lake for it’s colour and mountain backdrop. </span></div>",

Definitely sketchy (see pix!!). Well worth the drive though! Stopped through at the different campgrounds and the vibes we got were: Alce's Lake (Moose?): The partiers, maybe not quite as quiet and private. Packrat was quiet and there was a boat launch there, but again, not super private. Inlet Creek Campground would be ideal for group camping, as it was a circle of open campsites. Home Basin is where we stayed, enjoying the privacy of the individual sites, as well as the quietness, and beautiful view of the lake. We also backpacked in to Cave Creek Campground, which is only accessible via hiking (relatively easy hike, &lt;1hr, 2.7km) or by boat. Overall it was an incredible experience. Toilets were pit only, no showers or drinking water (had washing water that had to be boiled), and there were food lockers out at Cave Creek campground. We had a skunk at our site, so be sure to pack up your things! It cost $23 a night at Home Basin, and $5/person a night at Cave Creek. Also, there is an on-site host who sells firewood at a reasonable rate. Another bonus is stopping at Lussier Hot springs on your way in! We would definitely recommend this campground, but NOT for large trailers (unless you're super comfortable with the roads, see pic).</span></div>",

While some lodge-based operations do not offer the opportunity to reschedule, Big Red Cats does, for up to two years, and it is fully transferable.  It is very rare, but sometimes we do have to reschedule because of a high likelihood of a guest being seriously injured due to poor conditions such as an ice crust. Unfortunately, you weren't able to come back to enjoy the cat skiing, but I was very happy to hear that since your wholesaler hadn't made you aware of the booking policy, they were able to refund you and their credit was used for another club this year instead.   I do hope that you are able to come back to the area sometime when the conditions are better - this year we didn't have to cancel anyone due to conditions, but unfortunately when you were here the whole province suffered a bout of freezing rain.  If you do return, I can understand that you may want to see if standby seats are available and come that way.  If you come in the beginning of January or the end of March, standby seats are often available.  To book during high season, you would have to book and pay in advance to ensure that you got a seat, but if you want 100% clarity on what the conditions are going to be like before you book, and your dates are flexible, I agree that standby is a good way to go.</div></div>",

The Bistro was actually a shed where you order your food and the meals were cooked.  The seating was numerous tables placed on wine barrels, plus a few cabanas with patio sofas.  We chose the cabana, which had a great view of the valley. The menu was fairly small, but with some interesting choices including pizza. Unfortunately, they were out of the Lamb Meatballs, which my brother told me were out of this world.  We settled on Pakoras and the Butter Chicken.  The food came quickly.  The pakoras were hot, light and crispy.  The chickpea flour was just right with the hint of turmeric (I think).  They came with 2 tamarind dipping sauces. We thought they were same. However one was sweet, and the other was a bit more tart and a tad spicy.  The butter chicken was unbelievable.  I can't believe a small little shed like that could turn out the quality of butter chicken (or  pakora for that matter), really means ""don't judge a book by its cover"".  The sauce was rich with all the right spices, definitely not out a jar.  it was extremely tasty, with a nice little heat.  The chicken came in boneless chunks that tasted as if they had been cooking all day.  Very tender too.  The naan that came with chicken was the perfect side  The whole meal was enough to fill the 3 of us.  Needless to say, the wine we ordered with it was perfect.  My only regret was that I forgot to take a picture before we polished off the food. I hope to get a chance to return.</span></div>",< 1 hour

This provincial park is a series of  3+ interconnected lakes, some only accessible by boat.  The camp spots are secluded and gorgeous, right on the lake.  Here are some ideas for your trip.<br><br>You can park at Village Bay Lake and launch your boat or kayak at the dock here.  Go past the cottages and take the connecting stream to Mine Lake.  This will get you to the start of the camping areas.  The campsites are well treed, have a toilet but no picnic tables.  Some come with their own sandy beach.  Depending on the time of year, you can scout out the spots and take the best one however, it can be quite busy in the summer and sometimes there are no spots left.<br><br>Another place where you can park and launch your boat is Mine Lake.  There is no dock here but it provides closer access to the campsites.  The parking lot however is small and often full.   <br><br>There are some motor restrictions on these lakes.  There are no services here (ie store or gas) so you need to bring all your supplies with you.  The closest store is in Heriot Bay.<br><br>These lakes are perfect for kayaking, canoeing, swimming and fishing for trout.  Be sure to check out the rock bluffs for diving on Village Bay Lake, a popular swimming spot.</span></div>",

There are hiking trails around as well.  It would likely be quite hot in the afternoon, but was just perfect in the early evening.  Might be a bit treacherous to drive out in the dark though so perhaps not the best place for a sunset.  No bathroom facilities.</span></div>",1-2 hours

The outhouses are well kept which is good for those of us who are accustomed to our mod cons. The lake is clean and comfortable to swim in, the beach is sandy and clean.

There were 7 guests with an age range from 30s to 60s and 2 guides, with pickup and drop-off in Vancouver (Days 1 and 10) and 8 days canoeing.  We had an excellent time in very pleasant company and will undoubtedly do something similar in future.<br><br>The lakes are tranquil, with abundant wild life – we saw black-bear, porcupine, moose, chipmunks, beaver, ground squirrels and many birds.  Most days we saw a few other canoes and the occasional park ranger.  Weather was warm, though it rained most nights and occasionally during the day, and biting insects absent from all except one camp location.  All equipment except for personal clothing was provided.  The guides (Bill and Erin) were superb – their leadership, companionship and (especially) culinary skills were excellent.<br><br>The trip was advertised as suitable for novices, though all had had some albeit minimal experience.  The route requires some porterage between lakes (one of 2.4 kms but otherwise each less than 1.5 km), mainly on the first two days, but wheeled cradles are provided.  The guides woke us up each morning once tea or coffee was prepared and we set off after breakfast having packed our equipment.  We paddled for about 3 hours at a leisurely pace, pausing to regroup, take photos, observe the wildlife or have a snack before lunch.  We went ashore for a leisurely lunch with usually a much shorter paddle in the afternoon.  We used campsites reserved for groups so with one exception we were the only ones at the sites.  Each campsite had a prepared base for individual tents and ‘food safes’ for storage of food and ‘smellies’ overnight so as not to attract bears.  The guides prepared a covered area for general socializing and eating, made more hospitable by a log fire.  The food was excellent, with various dietary needs being catered for, and plentiful.  The guides provided instruction both during the days travelling as well as bespoke instruction on arrival at the camp sites.  <br><br>We finished paddling at lunch on Day 9, and spent the night after an excursion to Barkerville village at a motel in Quesnel for a clean-up and well deserved meal.</span></div>",

If like me you want to grab a bite prior to heading out the Boundary Bay Regional Park, get off at stop 12 Ave at 56 St., as there is a local shopping village here with a Tim Hortons. From here, walk along 12 Ave and it’ll be about 10 minutes before you arrive at the 12 Ave entrance of Boundary Bay Regional Park. The #601 bus stop back to Bridgeport Station is located in front of the Chevron petrol station on 56 St.<br><br>I previously read online that one of the better viewing areas for the wild birds is the section between 64 St and 72 St. To get here, once you’re almost at the entrance of the park, turn left at Beach Grove Rd. It’s a residential street with many beautiful houses and keep walking until the end of the road (felt like it took about 20 minutes from the 12 Ave entrance). When you’re at the end of Beach Grove Rd, the Dyke Trail begins on the right and according to the park map, it’s about a 1.8km walk to 64 St. I spotted some juvenile eagles sitting atop the trees at the entrance here too, so don’t forget to look up.<br><br>I only visited mid-March (I think prime time is Nov-Feb), so I only saw some adult and juvenile eagles and a couple of hawks and with it being outdoors, I prefer to visit on non-rainy days. There were many locals walking with their dogs and cyclists too.<br><br>Then from here, walk back the same direction to head to the more-populated area of the park, where Centennial Beach is. From the entrance at 12 Ave, according to the park map the walk along the 12 Ave Dyke Trail is a 4km return trip. Along the dyke trail I managed to see many seagulls, ducks and ravens/crows, a juvenile eagle and a great blue heron, but the mountains in the background is closer from this section park compared to the other dyke trail at 64 St.<br><br>On your way back, you can take the Raptor Trail which takes you through the wildlife reserve. On this trail, I managed to see a few wild rabbits, a couple of woolly bear caterpillars, a hummingbird (don’t know which species it is, but it was green) and another great blue heron. <br><br>I visited on an overcast day and it was still quite chilly because of the winds, however overall it was still a great day out enjoying what nature has to offer.</span></div>",

There is also an old schoolhouse from bygone days. The museum has a play area for children as well as a room that can be used for children's birthday parties.   Family annual passes are available (which can be used at other museums in B.C.)

Small parking area here that the owners of the road probably made to keep cars off the main road (guess). This appears to be an active industrial road so watch out for trucks and the gate before the work yard indicates it is locked from 6pm to 6 am. <br>The view from the suspension bridge is fantastic. This is part of the Trans Canada Trail.

This should be mentioned in guide books because we were prime targets for a mugging but we followed the rule of head down and keep walking, no eye contact and no maps, wallet or camera in view.<br>Saying that, it did at least have a high police presence which is more I can say for the ghetto areas of the UK.<br>get a taxi to take you to the nice street and dont stray outside it.<br>I am a firefighter so went over to have a chat to the Vancouver guys when they were at a job. They were stationed in or near gastown and couldn't believe we had walked through the areas I mentioned (and these are BIG guys I was talking to). Just that morning one of the firefighters had seen 2 muggings and a prostitute ""going about her business"" on his way to work. We were lucky to get off scott free he said!!<br>At one point we walked past a park and at first thought ""phew, a park full of kids, we must be safer now"" - NOPE, as we got closer we realised they were not kids but groups of addicts. vancouver seriously needs to sort that area out because it is too close to the tourist area for comfort.<br></span></div>",< 1 hour

It has always been a great fishing lake, with nice rainbow trout and lake trout. The lake is generally cooler than other lakes in the area, due to the many creeks, rivers and springs running into it, but by mid-summer it is usually quite warm.<br>  In 1972 the province purchased the property and turned it into one of the most beautiful  Provincial Parks in BC. It has become so  popular, that it is very difficult for the locals to get a site for weekend camping. July and August is pretty much impossible. Overall, great park, beautiful scenery, and one of the freshest, cleanest lakes you will ever see!!</span></div>",

Certainly expected the fruits and vegetables, but a good amount of local artisans too, which I enjoyed.  Also a lot of food vendors for snacking, and cold drinks to cool us of in the hot weather.  My daughter particularly enjoyed the Chick Holding Station, which is exactly what it sounds like -  for a donation, you can hold a baby chick in your hands for as long as you like. <br><br>Overall, as a tourist, I'm glad I stopped by.

Dennie has a great sense of style and is a wonderful person to talk to about the art style you may be thinking of for based on your personal taste. Dennie has also been able to get most of the prominent Western Canadian artists who work in oils, mixed media, stone sculptures, acrylics, porcelain, etc into her gallery. Names like Ma, Langevin, Svob, Ward, O'Toole, Bachmann, Buytendorp, Flaig, Hermeth, Muccillo, Wylie,Zhang all have their works in her gallery. Dennie's staff members Amy and Frances are extremely knowledgable and a delight to work with. Besides having a great gallery filled with great art works what Dennie has been able to achieve is a great eye for the framing of these artist's works. If you have ever seen great art poorly framed you will understand when I say that at White Rock Gallery the framing used on all the paintings is spot on. I would suspect that when art is bought as originaly framed it is rarely reframed. Inside of going to Vancouver and paying not only for the art piece but the high overhead come to White Rock and be delighted by the gallery layout, the staff, the artists exhibited and the fair pricing.  </span></div>",

Went on an overcast day so the crowds were low. <br><br>If you want to try something different from the normal wine tasting tours give the cider a try.</span></div>",1-2 hours

The area is really nice and the campground is good, but there is a next to no maintenance or cleanup. The deck is falling apart and can be a danger to walk on, there is trash laying around, shrubs growing in the changing rooms, some of the outhouses are fallen over, the tubs are filthy… overall I don’t understand what the money you pay goes to because it sure isn’t towards operations. I’ve talked to some of the older folks in Pemberton that have claimed that these hot springs were in better shape and better maintained back when they were free, because willing people would fix things. Now that it’s paid no volunteers will go do it and whoever runs the site now sure isn’t interested in getting it done. Personally, I’d recommend hiking to one of the free natural hot springs around the Pemberton area instead, or actually visiting a resort that has to pass some sort of health and safety inspection.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

The Fort is full of really interesting artifacts and buildings from the time it was in operation. Also, the Fort is right on Stuart Lake which is a very large lake so it just feels very cool to be there and looking out at this giant lake. We enjoyed our time there so much that we came back the next day and ate at the restaurant. We had the pulled rabbit sandwich which was delicious with a big enough portion to feel satisfied. Oh, they also have vegetarian dishes. And, this being the summer of 2020, we were in the middle of a pandemic so much of the Fort's activities were not operating. The whole experience will be even better when the COVID-19 pandemic is behind all of us!!!!</span></div>",

The first km or so is on a dirt road along the creek and is just a lovely stroll up a gentle grade. This creek provides the town's water supply and the road is apparently for that access. We were able to pick some nice wild raspberries right by the road.<br><br>When the road ends, the trail starts up the mountain in earnest. It is well groomed but fairly steep. There are some nice spots for views over the valley.

In short, the Trading Post became a “spot with character,” to quote an earlier reviewer. It’s a hodgepodge of stuff, to be sure, but there is an order to the madness and it’s a beautiful thing.<br><br>I admit to always being intrigued by the Trading Post. I can recall passing through Burns Lake with the folks in early to late 1990s and spying the inflatable jack-o’-lantern from our car window. “What’s in there?,” I thought, “and why is there a jack-o’-lantern up? It’s summertime!” The eclectic nature of the shop’s exterior had my young mind running wild with possibilities! Little did I know that nearly 20 years would pass before I’d finally get the chance to patronize this establishment.<br><br>Fast-forward to the current day. My partner and I were in the midst of our Mid-Summer adventure, cruising along Highway 16 en route to Prince George. As we approached the Burns Lake area, we spied the unmistakable Jack-o’-lantern of the Trading Post and decided to stop by because . . . why not? The moment we entered the premises, we were greeted by Janet, daughter of the original owner. She invited us to explore – and we did for a good 25 or so minutes. I think it would be pointless to try and describe what you’ll find here because, well, this place has a bit of everything. Want a 1950s-era antique? A colourful decoration for your home? Something strange and unique? A soda pop? All that and more is here. Indeed, we were able to find a few unique gifts over the course of our scouring.<br><br>The Decker Lake Trading Post has been acknowledged as “a fixture in the community” by My Bulkley Lakes Now news outlet and, after visiting this shop, it’s easy to see why. It’s full of character; it’s unique; and it’s of and for the community. Do yourself a favour and check it out if you’re in the area!</span></div>",

I haven't been up that way since 1998 and before that made my first visit in 1986. In 86 we parked in the gravel parking area, walked across a small shallow creek at the edge of the parking area and walked another 50 yards to take a little walk along the glaciers edge ( actually up on the ice about 25 feet above the rocks). In 1998 I took my son and daughter ( she was 2 months before her birth the first visit) and I was shocked that the creek was a tiny ""lake"" and the glacier's edge wasalmost a 1/4 of a mile away from the parking area. This is a real eye opener for those who don't buy into the Global Warming ""theory"". What I see in these  more recent pictures is beautiful but makes me so sad. The glacier was halfway up the sides of the ""valley"" that it has created in the mountain.</span></div>",

There's always a lot of action in the hit to pass classes, so you're guaranteed some good entertainment. Basic concession foods: hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken strips, fries, onion rings, poutine, and a candy booth. The foods a little pricey, so I'd recommend eating dinner before hand then just snacking at the track, as you cant bring in you're own food and drinks (if you have a special diet, they'll let you bring in some of your own snacks; I brought a toddler allergic to peanuts and they had no problem with me bringing in our own lunch bag of snacks). And they do check your bags to make sure your not bringing in anything you shouldn't be, like food, drinks, or booze. Admission is a little pricey for special events like monster trucks or fireworks ($22.50 for an adult) but $15 for regular race nights is reasonable. And they offer family packs of tickets for a discounted rate that makes it a little more affordable. Don't have too many of the ciders they sell in the beer gardens. They give you a wicked hangover. Make sure to bring a camera! And blankets or stadium seats to sit on (the grandstands get uncomfortable after the first hour).</span></div>",

I am glad I read a few reviews before venturing forth, because there are a few options in terms of length of your hike. <br>The trails are marked, with small coloured squares that in places are quite confusing. The two signs with maps explaining ""you are here"" were mounted fairly high up so difficult for a short person to read. <br>We did the medium-length route between the two lakes. <br>Once we recovered from the long and mildly-steep climb, it leveled out and was more enjoyable, although the return down the last stretch required slow going to avoid tripping or becoming a runaway hiker! The scenery was fantastic, and the lakes charming in the dazzling sunlight.  <br>The entire trail is well groomed. A few interpretive signs would be a bonus, as would better way-finding posts. It took us one hour and twenty minutes to complete.<br>The Bear In Area sign was a tad alarming, but it goes with the territory and there were a few other folks hiking so we figured we were safe.</span></div>",

Two of the main access points are easily accessible by major transit routes which is a bonus being a vehicular virgin. Highly recommend to any visitors looking for a structured, unspoilt walk in Victoria.</span></div>",

Back on the boat we motored passed Mitlenatch Island, a nature Provincial Park. We saw many harbour seals, Steller's and California sea lions as well as various birds, oystercatchers, gulls, Cormorants and Pigeon Guillemots to name a few.<br>On the way back from Mitlenatch we were fortunate enough to see hump back whales, a great way to end a great trip.</span></div>",

The other campers were very inconsiderate of others and many let their children run wild and screaming. This would start each morning around 5:30-6. We got zero sleep. We cut our trip short and stayed at a hotel instead on our last night because we couldn't deal with the inconsiderate loud people and trailers any longer.

Interesting to hear how the town got it’s name, the smelting? plant that was never used, and I was fascinated by the display about Eidelweiss.

The Lake is stunning and has amazing views of the mountains.  the water was refreshing and easy to swim in.  The dock, canoes, were in great shape, and the park rangers made renting one really easy.  If you are looking to get out of the bustle of Vancouver, and not be to close to the city, I highly recommend this provincial park.

Lightbulbs are not replaced in the change rooms.  The cubicle walls are covered with graffiti and need replacement.  Your skin smells nasty after swimming in the pools.

Getting from Banff to Sinclair Canyon requires that you turn off the main highway leading to Lake Louise and into Kootenay National Park.  The park is traversed via a 60 mile road, ending near Radium and the famous Radium Hot Springs.  Stops for the beautiful Stanley Glacier hike and for spectacular Marble Canyon are located on the first few miles of this road and are well worth your time. <br><br>But after you've passed Marble Canyon, it's another 50 or so fairly unremarkable miles until you reach Radium and nearby Sinclair Canyon.  The canyon, itself, while certainly nice, just isn't very big  (especially in the context of surrounding Rocky Mountain scenery) and takes about 5 seconds, literally, to drive through.<br><br>Once you've seen the canyon, there's no direct route between Radium and Banff.  To return to Banff, your only option is to turn the car around and simply retrace your steps the 60 miles back through the entire length of Kootenay.<br><br>Is Sinclair Canyon enough of a stand-alone sight to justify driving 100 miles out of your way to see?  To some, maybe.  To our group, not really.</span></div>",

It deserves to be invested in by the local tourist board. The place was hardly heaving when we went and yet we learned so much, wandering in and out of the different areas.

Royal Vape Kitsilano,,Speciality & Gift Shops,16,#161 of 187 Shopping in Vancouver,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM"">Kitsilano is one of Vancouver's most transformative neighbourhoods. With a long history of coffee culture and poetry readings, its days of flower children and buskers may be long-gone, but not without leaving their mark on the number of organic restaurants and fair-trade cafes in the area. At the centre of Kitsilano (""Kits"" for short) the almost idyllic expanse of Kits Beach offers the opportunity for a relaxed afternoon of beach volleyball or sunbathing. Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances. The multitude of both families and public spaces also make it a happening neighbourhood in the summer, when festivals and fairs take to Kits' streets.</div>",< 1 hour

With a long history of coffee culture and poetry readings, its days of flower children and buskers may be long-gone, but not without leaving their mark on the number of organic restaurants and fair-trade cafes in the area. At the centre of Kitsilano (""Kits"" for short) the almost idyllic expanse of Kits Beach offers the opportunity for a relaxed afternoon of beach volleyball or sunbathing. Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances. The multitude of both families and public spaces also make it a happening neighbourhood in the summer, when festivals and fairs take to Kits' streets.</div>",

We got there and read the waiver and signed, and we went to go pay. The staff member at the front looked at the waiver and asked how old the youngest was, and he was 5 years old. The staff told my friends mom that she had to pay full price for herself to go and watch her son because he wasn't old enough to go by himself. But she wasn't jumping, so she asked to speak to a manager. The staff said that she was the only one there, and it was getting a little tense. The staff member said that that info was in the waiver, and her signing meant she agreed with it- but me and my friend read the waiver twice, and nothing states that children under 6 have to go with a paid adult. My friends mom wasn't gonna pay for herself (because she shouldn't have to!), but the staff member was getting annoyed, so finally, just the me, my friend, and her two siblings payed to go. We went in, and the youngest was kind of jumping on the trampolines, then the staff member came out and started yelling my friends mom. The mom said ""please stop yelling at me"" and the staff member replied with ""I'm not yelling at you! You're yelling at me!"" but the staff member was the one yelling! As the staff member was yelling at my friends mom, the youngest was jumping around on the trampolines with NO SUPERVISION! They say they charge the parents because they need to supervise their kids, but this is just a clear example that they only care about the money! On the website it even says they focus on safety. But they clearly don't! After a while, my friends mom just left and sat down on the benches out of the trampoline park. The staff member left, and me and my friend saw her on the phone. 5 minutes later, the police showed up! And we saw other staff members come out from the back, but the original staff member said that she was the only one there! The police went and talked to my friends mom, but they weren't on the staff member's side. The staff called the police not because of the young one jumping, but because the staff member told them that this mom was yelling at her, but she was the one yelling at the mom! The police told us to write an angry review and request our money back, and if they don't give it to us then we go back to extreme air park and demand it back. Also, it says on their website that to jump for one hour it costs $15. But you have to dig through their website to find that you have to pay $3 for socks as well. But socks are actually $5. So, I wouldn't recommend going there at all. I want a refund!</span></div>",1-2 hours

I got a dark bruise on the right side of my forehead because I got burned, a new dark spot below my eye. There was no apology whatsoever for the dark bruise and I was told it was normal for new spots to reappear. Fine, these are the risks of having these sorts of treatments.<br><br>I however suffered one last incident which is enough to never go again.<br><br>I had a micro-needling treatment scheduled on a Saturday, but because I had to do on-camera work the next day, I asked for another treatment that wouldn't pose any risk to my appearance as I know that micro-needling is quite invasive. They recommended the RevitaPen and said my skin would glow and look even better on Sunday for the on-camera work, so I went ahead with it.<br><br>That evening I began to get blisters on my chin, below my lip, along my cheeks and along my neck. I woke up the next morning and my face was swollen, bumpy all over and inflamed. My face was in pain. The bumps and swelling could still be seen through all the makeup.<br><br>It got worse over the next two days, it felt like my face was on fire, raw and just in pain. My lips were singed.<br>It is Wednesday and my face still hurts and my lips are still burning. My skin feels like sand paper, is super tight and is scaly &amp; peeling all over. My lips are still raw, dark and will likely peel in a couple of days. This is not what I wanted.<br><br>I sent more than a dozen photos and I got absolutely no empathy or apology whatsoever. In fact, she insinuated I was to blame for not reading the consent form, that was actually never presented to sign.<br><br>I asked for their advice on a treatment that would enable me to be specifically, camera-ready the next day.

Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular and lively, with young revelers taking to the streets in droves and keeping the party going until late. Granville Street, being mostly open to pedestrian-only traffic, has a healthy social life along its main thoroughfares, even outside of its cafes and pubs, spilling onto the sidewalks. The locals are chatty, the shops at its expansive Pacific Centre Mall are trendy, and the whole area seems to be on a sugar rush: in a good way.

What a fun store. So much to see, maybe too much .....  We had to wait about 15 minutes to enter due to customer limits because of covid regulations.  We felt bad for the owner because people kept lifting the rope to enter even though it was very clearly marked that only 4 people were allowed to be in the store at once.   People were rude to her because she asked them to wait outside... She spent most of her time monitoring people ignoring the rules , but she did find time to talk to us and was friendly.... We did buy a dress that was a little expensive, but not over the top. If you want thrift store prices, then don't shop there and don't complain about it either....My only down side would be how much stuff there  is makes it difficult to really look at everything.</span></div>",< 1 hour

Sorry to hear that you weren't aware of the criteria needed to rent a boat.
Just like any other recreational rentals, a credit card deposit is needed.  This amount changes depending on the piece of equipment you are renting.  We do want people to be aware of this before they arrive as otherwise they may not have the correct deposit amount and then the rental equipment would not be utilized.  A cancellation fee for not showing up is also  standard rental procedure.  These 2 items are discussed over the phone when the booking is made.
We are very clear on rental procedure and costs associated.  Any info needed in association with that is posted on the window where the rental process is carried through and we do ask everyone to read it.
There is a $10 insurance fee, which covers a customer for damages beyond a certain amount, which again changes-depending on the type of equipment.  This is stated in the waiver you sign, in person and posted on the window.  A customer will always have to be responsible for damages they incur while renting-no different than renting a car or a hotel room.  
The rental equipment is inspected thoroughly every morning and after each rental and a customer only pays for damages that they do.
We hope this clarifies things for you.  If you have questions, we are more than happy to answer them.</div></div>",

Located in bustling downtown Queen Charlotte, this eclectic place of many treasures is housed inside the “historic Legion building.” Given the nature of this shop, I think it’s quite apt and no coincidence that the equally quirky Queen B’s is just one floor below in the same building. One could even suggest that the two go hand-in-hand. You know, complete your shopping experience and then top it off with a coffee and pastry of some kind all while admiring Skidegate Inlet. It’s a good combo to be had!<br><br>Anyway, I digress a little. I think Funk It! can be a bit deceiving, at least in terms of size and what’s to be found inside. From the outside, this shop looks fairly small; however, once you enter the enticing doors, you’re immediately greeted by . . . well, everything and anything. The shop is deceptively large and contains practically everything under the sun. Signage posted outside Funk It! says you can find “home décor, furniture, collectables, local art [and] souvenirs,” but I think that’s putting it lightly. Whether you’re looking for vintage or contemporary, modern or postmodern, you can probably find it here.<br><br>I think pricing is generally fair, but the layout is kind of all over the place. Certain areas of Funk It! come across as junky, which can make finding your “treasure” a bit more difficult. But then, maybe that’s the intention? After all, they do say the search represents a large part of the reward once you find that missing piece. Will you find what you’re looking for here?

I remember that the greens were one of the nicest of any course around no matter what time of year you played. It’s all changed now. The greens (if you want to call them that) were so bad. For example, the netting is showing on a number of greens, one green had tire tracks and most if not all, with the exception of 18, had dirt patches - not dried grass but actual dirt! Every green was lumpy, nothing to read there - every putt is a crap shoot. The fairways aren’t much better. Then the marshal shows up to tell us we’re a whole hole behind. No problem, we pick up the pace  only to wait on every hole following. So at the end of the round we go in to give feedback and are told that the greens were lost 2 days ago! Don’t believe it for a second. When you can see dirt and netting, that’s poor maintenance. The greens keeper should be fired! And on top of it all we’re charged full price! At the very least we should have been given a discount, along with every other golfer out there. Just terrible. I will not go back. I’m disappointed that I didn’t take pictures to back up this feed back.</span></div>",

Its youthful vibe owes to the many young families and young professionals who live there, bolstering nightlife and restaurant variety along its cobbled streets.

There were 7 girls including the 2 with me and approximately 30-35 guys. Middle aged men over 40 and other young guys, mostly of Indian ethnicity. That was not the issue. The main issue was these guys were all trying to grab at the girls, and much of our dancing time went pushing them away from us.

Spa Pure,3.0,Spas,7,#8 of 10 Spas & Wellness in Kamloops,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">This establishment used to be worth the mediocre  treatments because of the very affordable prices but when owners switched a few years back the prices continually went up and service experiences went down. The pedicures are not great but better then many other places in town, it is hard to find good places these days that excel in both good work/service and customer service. The massages are less then average. It is the staff which I find are unprofessional. Nothing worse then being stuck in a room with someone giving you a long massage when they have bad breathe and body odor. If you are in a pinch and need somewhere to go then they will do but not a place I recommend. Also with the many pedi chairs it can get quite loud at busy times and is not relaxing at all. They expanded the waiting area but it is still uncomfortable and the reception is always either on the phone or talking with staff and can forget to even check you in. The last visit I sat there for 20 mins before they even acknowledged me as I got tired of waiting for her to get off the phone so sat down and in that time other people came out of their appointments and one would have thought she would have said something to me but she kept helping others who were leaving and showing up and then talking to staff who were not busy. I was in disbelief and starting to panic wondering if I would ever get to talk to someone and my time was shorted for my massage  because she had another appointment after me which I felt was unfair as I was there on time actually ahead of time but was ignored by reception. Be prepared to get this kind of service as this kind of neglect  has always happened.</span></div>",

Bonny's Taxi,3.0,Taxis & Shuttles,16,#2 of 3 Transportation in Burnaby,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">I have used Bonny’s Taxi multiple times as they are the most local to me and they get worse and worse every time. I sent the below email to them on June 20th   <br><br>“Hello,<br><br>I tried booking a cab through this app yesterday. The first trip was cancelled by the driver so I booked again. This one went through and I waited for my taxi. When he arrived (cab 132) he made accusatory comments about how I needed to put my phone number in because how could he contact me? I told him my phone number was in the app. He changed his tune and started telling me how bad the app was. Then I arrived at my home and noticed someone was calling me. I picked up and a man said he was a cab and was waiting for me. I explained that I had already taken my taxi and that the number of the cab that picked me up matched the app so I did not get in the wrong one. He said “well they dispatched me” I apologised and he rudely hung up on me. I then listened to the voicemail the second driver left me before I took his call where he is accusing me of not being at the entrance and where was I and didn’t I know I called a cab? The entire time on my app screen it only showed 1 trip. I don’t know how or why the second driver was dispatched. I use you guys all the time because you are local and I liked that you had an app but the amount of unprofessionalism I experienced was unacceptable.” <br><br>I received a response this morning, September 4th with a zip file titled “Bonny’s Taxi” and the body of the email says, “see attached document”.<br><br>In addition to their unprofessionalism, they are often late, and I find that they don’t like to go the route you request. When I take a taxi home from work, I know the shortest route. They seem to be less than impressed that I want to go a different way, likely because it is shorter. <br><br>Long story short, you are better off using any other Taxi company. <br><br></span></div>",

We went to one of their newer locations behind Costco.<br><br>We were a group of 10. It was $30 per person at the newer location. We wanted to do the Airplane escape room. <br><br>First off, regardless if you have 2 people or 10 people, they will still charge you $30 per person. This is a huge cash grab.<br><br>We ended up opting to have the girls go in one room and the boys in the airplane room, and this was a great plan as the airplane room was really tiny and would never have fit 10 people.<br><br>Five people in the airplane room. The puzzles sometimes did not make sense, and the clues weren't the most helpful. For example, at the start you're shown a video suggesting that the plane crashed on land. You're inside the plane, which would suggest the wreckage was on land. Despite this, one of the clues was ""Where did you crash?"" and despite all logical reasoning, the answer was in the middle of the ocean. We ended up losing all of our time because this clue was illogical. <br><br>There was another clue you had to solve to get two sets of two numbers. The problem was these numbers were to open two combination locks of 3 digits each. So we're short two numbers. The answer? Add zero. There was nothing suggesting that, nor did it make any sense.<br><br>My friends and I gave them another chance, this time we put all 10 people in the Atlantis room. Big mistake. When you have such a big group, it leaves more than half with nothing to do, while paying the cash grab of $300 for the time you are in the room. <br><br>Exit has nice rooms and decor. Friendly enough staff. But whomever designed their puzzles have designed it in a way that you're set up to leave frustrated.<br><br>Not all escape rooms are bad, however, I went to another one in the Vancouver area that was much better done for half the price. See my other review for that.</span></div>",1-2 hours

I was in a rush and called for a taxi I was told it could be up to a 15 minute wait so I went out and stood in the rain for 15 minutes because I didn't want the taxi to miss me. After 15 minutes I called again and was told that the taxi had arrived, that he said we spoke on the phone and I had canceled the taxi ride. After saying that I absolutely spoke to no one on the phone nor had any taxi shown up I was basically called a liar and told another cab was on its way but it could take up to 15 minutes!!!! I asked to speak to management and was told by someone who sounded 16 ""well what can you do"". I'd like to say this was the first time but it was not, if you pre-order a taxi prepare for it not to arrive and prepare for the worst service you can possibly imagine.

The Spa at Ramada,2.0,Spas,9,#4 of 5 Spas & Wellness in Harrison Hot Springs,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">I am no diva. I don't have a super high standard for getting aesthetics treatments. However, I do like getting my money's worth. And I do expect my treatments to be done by people with training. Paying to get aesthetics done at a ""spa""- I expect more than something I would get from a teenage slumber party. This was NOT worth the money. Let me tell you why. <br><br>First of all, I had trouble booking- calls were not returned and I had to chase them down. At first when me and my two girlfriends arrived- it wasn't a bad looking spa. We had booked manicures, pedicures and facials. One of my friends had booked a massage. They were short staffed to accommodate the 3 of us. We were more than willing to come back, stagger things or whatever. We were in no rush. We had the whole weekend. They decided to give 2 of us our pedicures and 1 friend would receive her facial ""at the same time."" Unfortunately, it went downhill from there.The pedicure area consisted of those 40$ Dr. Scholl's at home foot spa's and a couple of Ikea chairs. The manicures were sub-par at best. No massage. No real scrubbing of the feet or getting rid of dry/dead skin. My feet were in pretty good shape due to the time of year so I would have been really mad if they hadn't been. Here is the kicker- while I was getting my pedicure- our 3rd friend who was getting a facial 'at the same time' paid 40$ to get some gel put on her face…sit for 10 minutes then get it wiped off….and my friend pointed out that she didn't think the girl who was doing my pedicure at the same time (I will not call her an aesthetician…) didn't wash her hands in between touching my feet and her face!! Unbelievable….suffice it to say- the manicures were not any better, and neither was the massage. Complete waste of money. But wait…there's more!!<br><br>The owner showed up half way through our treatments, and was so 'nice' and 'apologetic' about the lack of staff etc etc. Offered us drinks and perhaps an appy from her restaurant that was across the way. Seemed like we were being compensated for our trouble….and we were now to receive 25% off our meal if we came to her restaurant for dinner that night, Villa Toscana. So- we thought, okay- she's redeeming herself not too badly….well- after dinner, we got the bill. We had been charged for our drinks we received at the salon earlier- that we were given the impression were comped….and she screwed us and didn't take 25% off the bill- we pointed it out 3 times…only ever got the 15% off that you get anyways as a coupon at the Ramada- she was babbling and carrying on about this and that and why the bill was what it was. POOR POOR POOR customer service!! The food at Villa Toscana wasn't bad……overpriced a bit...but due to the service we received we would never go back!!!! There are other salon's/spa's in Harrison- go there! We almost went to the Hot Springs hotel for our spa treatments (Been there before, awesome) and you can spend the day at the hot pools when you get your spa treatments. It's expensive to stay there- but the Ramada was decent. That's how I will do it next time. Go for the quality spa. Plus there was an Aveda spa and I think a few others. Furthermore- restaurants- lots of good ones- Laughing Goat was awesome!, Muddy Water's Cafe and Black Forest Steak and Schnitzel to name a few…..</span></div>",

Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular and lively, with young revelers taking to the streets in droves and keeping the party going until late. Granville Street, being mostly open to pedestrian-only traffic, has a healthy social life along its main thoroughfares, even outside of its cafes and pubs, spilling onto the sidewalks. The locals are chatty, the shops at its expansive Pacific Centre Mall are trendy, and the whole area seems to be on a sugar rush: in a good way.

As you pass the cook house you will be stunned by the the view. We enjoyed pizza while we took in a fantastic view of the Cariboo Mountains Provincial Park.

So thought we would use the shuttle as a method of getting around the park and seeing the highlights. The shuttle does not start till 9 a.m. Type notes were written at the shuttle stop indicating that the shuttle would be running only once per hour at each stop instead of the expected half hour. When we got on the shuttle we ask the driver why he indicated that the second driver was out sick and he was the only driver. As we got on and off at different stops it was apparent that the estimated time of pickup as indicated by the driver was irrelevant and the actual time was sporadic and the actual time was sporadic. At several of the stops we begin walking at eventually flagged the shuttle down in between stops. When we decided to leave the park we were waiting and waiting for the shuttle. Eventually we gave a tip to a driver on a different brand of shuttle and he took us to the area of the bus stop for public transportation.<br><br>I would think during peak season they could find a substitute driver. I think the shuttle is designed to be taken as a single loop around the block and not as a genuine Hop Off hop on tour.</span></div>",

I had hoped to find a place in Parksville for incense and maybe some crystals, and after a quick Google, I found this listed. As soon as I went in, I was very impressed. There was a huge selection of incense: cones, sticks, real myrrh/resins, backflow incense burners, etc.<br><br>After choosing from the selection of incense, I had a look at the lovely selection of crystals and stones. They even had little cloth bags (made from saris, the woman told me) to keep them in. There was also a huge selection of tarot cards, books, and decorations. <br><br>I even got a free mini tarot reading as we perused the store. (which was eerily accurate) <br><br>During checkout, the cashier (owner? she seemed like maybe she was) took the time to place all my crystals and stones in individual baggies along with a card explaining what each stone/crystal meant and what energies they possessed. I didn't expect that at all and it was a really nice touch. <br><br>AND, to top it all off, because I spent a certain amount of money I got a free gift to choose from a large basket of items: break your own geodes, crystals, pendants, etc. (I picked the geode) <br><br>Really, really impressed with this store. I will absolutely return and even see myself making the trip from Victoria specifically to go to this store.</span></div>",

Having said that, I am glad I stuck with my appointment. I am now a huge fan!! This method works with many different holisitc approaches (acupressure, Thai massage, Shiatsu massage, Active Release Therapy, etc.) to help relieve tension in the body, specifically focusing on the bands (or meridians) of the body. Releasing this tension as well as any trigger points is work...but it is very much worth it! <br><br>Joshua worked miracles on my aches and pains and the dozens of knots and adhesions that I had. I would go weekly if I could afford it!! It is unfortunate that they don't have the RMT or reflexology designation so that I could claim it on my extended health benefits.

Since I was pregnant, I switched over to drinking tea. And I have been quite adventurous in trying out new tea so I was hoping to find a new twist or something that catch my eye rather than something that I have in mind in purchasing. We were immediately told that ""This is a shop, not a shopping mall."" Something on the line we can't be here to kill time. So we walked out immediately without saying more. <br><br>We passed by this store a few nights before when it was closed and noted that it would interesting to come back and check it out.

This man-made pond was created to retain the tailings from the mining of copper and molybdenum.   These metals' tailings produced the bright blue color but the many large, deep pits left by the removal of the ore scared the earth's surface forever.</span></div>",

I had booked an appointment for information only regarding cool sculpting. I met with Tara who answered all my questions with great kindness, patience and honesty. I was so comfortable in our meeting that I ended up asking about other services as well. I was really impressed in particular that at no point did she attempt to do pushy pricey up selling which unfortunately happens too often. She was genuine in her willingness to understand me and help. Well I ended up with cool sculpting, profound treatment for cellulite, teeth whitening, laser hair removal &amp; will be going back for facials!  Very happy with my results so far. Prior to this meeting I had been to another place to ask about cool sculpting . At this other place the girl was abrupt, not interested, made me feel like a bother and wrote me out a ridiculous package price list. I would highly recommend Tara to my friends &amp; family without hesitation. Being a nurse she has a medical background &amp; knowledge which made me feel I was in good hands. She went above &amp; beyond during treatment sessions to make sure I was comfortable. She also came in on her day off to accommodate my schedule!

The course is not really fancy with lots of amenities. It is a basic 9 hole golf course that people go to play games and then leave. There is no fancy bar, restaurant, electric golf cart rental, valet services, etc. The staff there are very observant, friendly, and professional which means good customer service. The grass condition is average and ok, not top of line manicured like at the really expensive Greater Victoria golf courses. This means you will pay $10.50 per person instead of around $35 for 9 holes. This would be the equivalent of golf version of fast food to feed your needs without the extra fancy packages. You get your basics done and then you go.</span></div>",1-2 hours

Went to Cranbrook's Landmark cinema recently.<br><br>First note was that it was tough to find. There is a sign on the main road but nothing to indicate where you go from there in the large retail park. Even downloading the Tamarack centre map didn't get me there. Eventually I just took a drive around the place and found it tucked in round the back of the Canadian tire. I had plenty of time so this wasn't a huge issue but still kind of odd.<br><br>I skipped the lines and bought a ticket from the automated machine. Can't comment on the popcorn, candy and drinks concession as I didn't get any.<br><br>Straight into the theatre and it struck me just how long it's been since I was in a cinema with such basic seating. I'm not saying it's essential but every cinema I've been in for about the last two years has had either magnificent fully electric reclining leather chairs or nice big plush ones with a bit of a swing recline. This place had the basic flip up seats. Nothing in particular wrong with them but I missed the extra comfort and found myself wondering just how long the chairs had been there (and how clean they were).  The ticket was $11.50 so pretty comparable in price to other locations.<br><br>No issues with the show. The screen was clear the sound was good. The crowd was having fun.<br><br>All in all pretty inoffensive and unremarkable. Better than a home cinema experience but nothing to make you look forward to your next visit. </span></div>",

Its youthful vibe owes to the many young families and young professionals who live there, bolstering nightlife and restaurant variety along its cobbled streets. It is the flagship neighbourhood for modern revitalization, and the It-Spot for boutique hotels and modish eats.</div>",1-2 hours

It's easily recognizable by the pink awnings left by the previous tenant.<br>Inside you'll find a clean, airy store, tastefully appointed with chandeliers and crisp colours. It's not the decor that will impress you, though, but the racks and shelves of clothing, jewelry and accessories that will make the modern stylish woman cancel her next appointment and spend the next hour trying to decide which fabulous dress to choose. They carry mostly Vancouver Island, West Coast and Canadian designers so many items are unique and one-of-a-kind. They make some of the items right there in store and if it's slow you can custom order a screen print for the shirt or skirt of your choosing. They have body products and gift items too and they say they'll soon be carrying shoes.<br>The staff is courteous and professional and they will offer as little or as much help as you need. <br>Your wardrobe will thank you and you'll be sure to boast to your friends back home about the cute boutique you found on your trip to the beach on Vancouver Island.</span></div>",

Alanna was terrific, she took her time with the package I had a gift certificate for at the time. Helped me choose a nail colour from the Opi line. I had gone online to Opi site to figure out some choices before my appointmnet. So many choices so she asked what I liked and then pointed out a popular colour ""Don't call me a waitress"" and it was the colour I ended up choosing. The Essential Manicure is 45 minutes and you get a bit of a hand/arm massage in addition to everything else. I was so worried about nicking my nails because I always seem to ruin on my own within an hour. Alanna let me sit a bit longer and recommended that I take it easy and avoid for the next hour doing anything that may cause me to hit or nick my nails.<br><br>I decided to drive back home rather than do grocery shopping, avoided doing the dishes that night and that manicure lasted 10 days before I started to have little nicks. It simply was the best manicure ever in my life. Love the colour and its name!  Recommend the Haven and Alanna.</span></div>",

The staff are friendly, always with a smile. I have had lessons off one of their pros and Peter is very good.

With the lockdown, there is a limited list of places that people can go to and enjoy. <br><br>I am not surprised this place is a popular destination. When we arrived, the tide was very low, so the sandy and flat beach was a delight to walk around on. There are barely any big stones or rocks in the area, which makes it more enjoyable. I can only imagine when the tides come in how a perfect swimming place this can become. <br><br>Around the area, there is a rest area and enough parking for a camper or two. There is also a viewpoint feature made out of cement and driftwood that you can climb to get a better view.  There is an area that has a clearing of sorts with some pit fires feature to possibly use for night camping. On daytime, it looks a bit overgrown with the weeds but it looks peaceful and safe to hang out. <br><br>We also noticed some wild berry flowers jutting out - and we would come back here to see if we can sample them in a month or two (Mmm...delicious berries!). As to the Jungle Beach name, we are not sure how it came to that name, but it sure is a place where you can relax and enjoy the sand, sea, and sky. <br><br>One final observation: There was a surprising amount of litter near the beach's entrance. How incredibly disheartening to see this! I'd think people would be a little more respectful of this place?<br><br>Jungle Beach is easy to find. Just watch out for the ""JUNGLE BEACH"" sign and the iconic, carved black bear!</span></div>",2-3 hours

This lookout provides a great view of the lake, the city, highway 97 and other scenic surroundings.

Now for the negatives! 1) It took 2.5 months for them to get me an appointment 2) I called the front desk to say we were running 5min behind due to traffic (we ended up 2min late) and she says I will be removing it from your massage time, I said I would prefer it not as I paid for what I paid for and would like to receive it she kept on with attitude I said it is what it is and hung up 3) when we got there the front desk lady was still rude not even a hello from her all we got was fill these out and sit here 4) our massages were very tender but honestly not worth the money spent at all, all they did was really spread lotion all over our back side of our bodies didn't even get to the front 5) our massage was supposed to be one hour, our appointment was at 2 we got there 2:02 paper work fill out and prep for massage 2:20 massage started 3pm massage finished?

Cloud 9 Float Spa,4.0,Spas,5,#4 of 7 Spas & Wellness in Coquitlam,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">Spa is spotless and welcoming and the staff are very nice.  Enjoyed the Hydro Massage bed; very relaxing and a good workout for my muscles.  I told the staff that I experience claustrophobia so they gave me a float tank with an open top.  Each room has its own private shower and when you are ready the lights in your spa room go out.  The staff member showed me that the tank had an LED light on the side that I could turn off or leave on if I needed to.  I decided to leave it on; however, at one point I turned it off and it was pitch black.  Took me a while to relax in the tank because I don't like water in my ears.  I was provided with ear plugs, but I still didn't feel that was enough to keep the water out.  The water was warm and I really did try to relax; and the high concentration of Epsom salts leave your skin feeling soft.  At first I thought I wouldn't be able to stay in the tank for 75 minutes, but the time flew by and when the music and light came on I was surprised I had been in that long.  I really envy individuals who can let themselves just BE because I think this is a very healthy way to energize, detoxify and at the same time, relax your body.  The spa is spotless.  Patrons shower before and after entering the tank or pod.</span></div>",

We had a little tour of the place and decided to buy a couple pounds of scallops (I like scallops but don""t love them).<br>Well we got home and I cooked them in a little butter til they were lovely and dark golden but still opaque then deglazed the pan with a little white wine and lemon juice, mounted this with a little fresh butter then drizzled this over the top of them.  Oh my god........incredible, so sweet and just melt in your mouth. I now LOVE scallops but only these ones, they are now being sold at our local seafood store, ""Seadrift Fish Market"" and we are buying them whenever I want a special dinner. They are somewhat pricey but worth every penny!!!!!<br><br>Thank you Island Scallops.</span></div>",< 1 hour

Royal Feet,5.0,Spas,2,#47 of 229 Spas & Wellness in Vancouver,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM"">Kitsilano is one of Vancouver's most transformative neighbourhoods. With a long history of coffee culture and poetry readings, its days of flower children and buskers may be long-gone, but not without leaving their mark on the number of organic restaurants and fair-trade cafes in the area. At the centre of Kitsilano (""Kits"" for short) the almost idyllic expanse of Kits Beach offers the opportunity for a relaxed afternoon of beach volleyball or sunbathing. Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances. The multitude of both families and public spaces also make it a happening neighbourhood in the summer, when festivals and fairs take to Kits' streets.</div>",

She made me look fabulous and did not even charge for the hair as we barely had time! I just wanted to show my appreciation and let Zoe know that this won't be forgotten and thank you so much for exemplary service and accommodating my needs! She is a true gem to the salon!</span></div>",

There are so many llamas and alpacas in the sanctuary and although some are shy, others love to take carrot sticks from our mouths and they are so gentle.  The blind alpaca was so much smart.  There are lots of trails through the 30 acre park, with a big pond and a creek.  We saw the coyote den and the llamas don’t seem to mind the coyotes.  The llamas hide in the forest when it’s hot, but they come out to eat the treats.  There is a special hospital barn for the elderly and the injured animals.  Mikey and Brownie are very old and they don’t like to walk very much, but they still like to eat apples and be cuddled.  I learned so much about llamas in 2 hours.  I will definitely go again.</span></div>",1-2 hours

With a long history of coffee culture and poetry readings, its days of flower children and buskers may be long-gone, but not without leaving their mark on the number of organic restaurants and fair-trade cafes in the area. At the centre of Kitsilano (""Kits"" for short) the almost idyllic expanse of Kits Beach offers the opportunity for a relaxed afternoon of beach volleyball or sunbathing. Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances. The multitude of both families and public spaces also make it a happening neighbourhood in the summer, when festivals and fairs take to Kits' streets.</div>",

Laura Waters has created a wonderful array of products on her farm, all packaged in her artistically designed packaging. . Utilizing the tips of Douglas Fir Trees on the property she makes the most delicious Douglas fir vinegar. Add a bit of sparkling water and it is the most refreshing drink. Run out of bread? Keep some of her bread mixes and mix them with a can of beer and put in the oven and have a delicious loaf of bread 40 minutes later - The Tomato and Basil Bread is my favorite and goes great with a warm bowl of her soup mixtures. She has brie toppers - Apricot and Mango - which I sometimes use on my toast as well, blueberry and other varieties. Garlic, onion herb mixes to combine with mayonnaise and sour cream to make a delicious dip when guests unexpectedly arrive. <br><br>I have also been lucky enough to attend her cooking explorations events where she creates delicious recipes using her products - thinking outside the box, for us to try.  I  recommend taking a drive out to Sidney by the Sea - follow the signs out to Snowdon House on Mills Road and see what a great place this is. Laura and the staff will always give you a warm welcome.</span></div>",< 1 hour

Totally enjoyed the movie. The complex was clean and Covid protocols were followed.  In general it was a good experience EXCEPT all the trailers except a Netflix ad for Paw Patrol  were for horror films. At least one of these trailers is for an R rated movie (Malignant). This was a matinee of a PG movie. There were young kids in the audience that should not be subjected to such frightening images of the horror movies.  It seems really bad marketing choices by whomever is in control of such decisions. How do horror movies go with Paw Patrol or a PG movie? Managers response was that they don’t make the decision but the film distribution companies do. Maybe or maybe he was throwing them under the bus. Whoever makes the decision needs to rethink them.</span></div>",

At least, a very detailed &amp; reliable review to help when you are in port in Victoria on an Alaskan cruise.  Just ~ 5 MINUTES walking on the main street towards Downtown!<br><br>We were docked in Victoria from 6pm - 11:30pm.  We didn't want to pay the $10 RT shuttle fare since we were a party of 4 and thought $40 was too much to waste when we were all able bodied.  We figured we would just walk into town and play it by ear.<br><br>So, we headed out and after about 5 minutes walking on to the main street we see the First Choice Tours bus parked along the side of the road with a sign that said ""$3 RT shuttle"".  We were initially wary but decided to ask anyway.  Sure enough no catch!  They took us and dropped us off right in front of the Empress Hotel and gave us a few tips that were very useful.  They informed us that pick up back to the ship was every 30 minutes on the hour and the half hour at the same spot they dropped us off.  <br><br>On our way back, we went back to the drop off point in front of the Empress Hotel a few minutes before 10:30pm and the shuttle bus was there waiting.  We hopped on the bus and it took us along with a few other cruisers all the way into OGDEN PORT.  It was a great deal &amp; reliable service.</span></div>",2-3 hours

I tried it out and was hooked as well.<br><br>However, I wanted to take a lesson and demo some boards before making a decision on what to buy for myself.<br><br>I arranged a 90 minute lesson with Jason and it was very valuable not only in helping me learn the basics but also which board to buy. <br><br>Jason is an excellent instructor. He was patient with me he had a very logical progression in the lesson. He tailored it to my level, covered the safety and legal aspects (PFD, whistle, etc), and showed me how to be a more confident and efficient paddler. His passion for SUP was evident and he was very encouraging.<br><br>Jason also showed me a variety of boards and explained what the differences were between them. He let me try each one which allowed me to experience the differences he had previously explained. I was therefore very comfortable in making an informed decision about what board to buy. <br><br>I was impressed so much with the knowledge and service from Jason that I decided to buy my board from them!<br><br>I would not hesitate to take a lesson, rental, or purchase a board from 3 Phase Adventures. <br><br>I have referred my friends who were on vacation in Osoyoos.

But the next time we went together we would meet at arranged times in the public areas to share time together.  When you pay for the massage it includes the price of admission into all the other areas but if you choose to just use the other spa facilities it is a great price.

To me it is equal to a massage or any other pampering you might want to do. You enter your own private room with your own private shower and float tank. The lighting is very soft and with warm colours (purple, green, etc). There is also light soft music. All very relaxing. <br><br>Put your ear plugs in before showering (HOT TIP) so that you know for sure they are in correctly (otherwise you get salt water in your ear and it gets crusty). <br><br>When you are floating, try putting your hands above your head for extra comfort (the introduction video will tell you this as well). <br><br>Try to meditate or at least enjoy the silence. There is literally no stimulation (visual, verbal) and its just you and yourself. This can seem uncomfortable for some people but you can learn to enjoy it and tap into yourself. I solve lots of problems when I am in the tank. Its your time and there is literally nothing to interfere with it. <br><br>Be careful not to get the water in your eyes or up your nose (splashing etc) it will burn like crazy!! Another HOT TIP be careful if you scratch your nose! When you get out of the tank keep your EYES CLOSED until you can rub the water out of your eyes. Another HOT TIP is to put a small towel on the handle of the tank, so when your time is over you can sit up (with your eyes closed) stick your hand out of the tank door and grab the towel to rub your eyes. When you sit up all the salt water from your hair will pour into your eyes. KEEP EM SHUT. <br><br>All in all, the jist is...relax, float, keep salt water out of your eyes/nose/ears :)</span></div>",1-2 hours

Finally at the 12th hole we were able to pass.  Lots of other issues, garbage cans were full, divot sand containers on cart were empty, most courses provide tees on the golf cart - none.

Thankfully I stumbled upon Namaste Day Spa, and researched the products they use, as I believe what goes on, goes in. The massage was incredible-I didn't know how much my arms and hands were missing some lovin' (not to mention my back and neck!). Then came the facial, which was just beyond luxurious. I was amazed at the end when I looked in the mirror, and my skin looked glowing, as I was expecting it to be pretty red because that's just how my skin reacts to things. I will DEFINITELY go back as regularly as I can, and I'm so thankful for Lisa and the staff at Namaste.Oh-and such a cute little house they run this business in! :)</span></div>",

At the centre of Kitsilano (""Kits"" for short) the almost idyllic expanse of Kits Beach offers the opportunity for a relaxed afternoon of beach volleyball or sunbathing. Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances. The multitude of both families and public spaces also make it a happening neighbourhood in the summer, when festivals and fairs take to Kits' streets.</div>",1-2 hours

With a long history of coffee culture and poetry readings, its days of flower children and buskers may be long-gone, but not without leaving their mark on the number of organic restaurants and fair-trade cafes in the area. At the centre of Kitsilano (""Kits"" for short) the almost idyllic expanse of Kits Beach offers the opportunity for a relaxed afternoon of beach volleyball or sunbathing. Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances. The multitude of both families and public spaces also make it a happening neighbourhood in the summer, when festivals and fairs take to Kits' streets.</div>",

This was my first experience using Amtrak so I had booked a Business Class seat since it wasn't much more in cost than Coach when I booked.<br><br>In the carriage I was in were 12 double configuration seats, plus 7 single seats. As a solo traveller I was given the latter. While it was nice not having someone I didn't know beside me, I was aware along the whole trip that the coast is on the left side .. ie, the side of the double seat configurations. <br><br>The seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room for me. There was a tray table provided and newspapers offered for reading. At my feet was a standard electrical outlet. There was no USB outlet.<br><br>Wifi seemed to work fine each time I used it, but as I wanted to enjoy the views from the train I only connected now and then so I can't say if it was reliable the entire journey. Certainly there was no problem connecting when I did.<br><br>I was impressed with the time for checking in and getting on the train. I think I literally walked into the station, checked in and was in my seat within 10 minutes, and maybe within only 5. <br><br>Getting off in Vancouver entailed going through a security checkpoint but only took a few minutes.<br><br>Overall, I found this first Amtrak experience to be easy, relaxing and enjoyable. I'd definitely travel this way between these two points rather than fly. Much nicer than airports!!</span></div>",More than 3 hours

It's a must stop when I'm anywhere near by. Owners are very knowledgeable about local goods and adventures as well as international and off grid travel experiences. They seek out and make connections with local like minded-folk. This shop is as much about H U B as S P A N.

Kiyo Salon & Boutique,4.0,Speciality & Gift Shops • Spas,7,#4 of 13 Spas & Wellness in Parksville,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">I've been to this salon twice. The first time I had my hair cut by a stylist named Emilia, and and she did a fantastic job. She was done in 20 minutes and gave me the exact style I had asked for. So I do not want to give negative feedback on the salon or the quality or most stylists. It is a good place. I just want to warn people about the awful stylist that I encountered on my second visit to mi by kiyo. I was there to have my prom hair done. My stylists name was Amanda. She's tall with dyed strawberry blonde hair, and had bright pink lipstick on the way that I was there. She did a terrible job. I'm not usually one to complain, and a hairdo that is a little different than what I was hoping for wouldn't lead me to write this review. What she did was truly awful, and so far from what I was asking for that it was ridiculous. I would almost find it comical if she hadn't been so rude about the situation. She raised her voice at me in exasperation and told me that I shouldn't have asked for something so impossible to do. What kind of stylist blames their customer for choosing something ""too hard"" for them? She simply should have told me that the hairstyle was unrealistic, and asked for me to choose something else. Instead she spent an hour back combing my hair and creating a monstrosity on top of my head that in no way resembled what I had asked for. And when I tried to cut in and tell her I didn't like what she was doing, which happened multiple times during the hour, she'd throw her hands up in exasperation, come to eye level with me, and with a voice as though I were a young and stupid child she'd say ""can you trust me? I do this a lot. I know what I'm doing."" She wouldn't accept any constructive criticism. In the end she re did my hair in something only fractionally less awful than the style that she had started with, and now months later I am still upset about the whole episode. I am desperately hoping to warn others away from her awful service. Choose another stylist, there are so many good ones at this salon that deserve your business. Not Amanda.</span></div>",< 1 hour

Irritated by the greeter, we decided to leave. As our bus was pulling away, the greeter yelled, “No free ride;” “No free ride here.” It was totally unprovoked and absolutely unbelievable.

We are from Brampton and Jellybeenz is the only place that comes close to this and is still far from being an equal to Just4Fun.

We’d wanted to see “The Death of Stalin” and, during our quick foray into Vancouver, this was the only cinema showing it at the time. In the end, we were quite pleased with our overall movie-going experience.<br><br>First opened in 1996, Fifth Avenue Cinemas is fairly small by modern standards (5 screens). It was purchased by Cineplex in 2013 and underwent a nice $2-million-dollar renovation in 2015. Along with relocating the lobby/main entrance to fifth avenue (how appropriate), the cinema itself was expanded by approximately 21,500 square feet so that it could include a full-service, licensed lounge. As well, the auditoriums were upgraded and updated with new, high-back leather chairs, carpeting and a fresh coat of paint. The end result was the establishment of a cinema restricted to 19+ (yay!), with a sleek, stylish interior reminiscent of Cineplex’s larger VIP complexes. For me, this was a welcomed changed and lent itself to creating a unique film experience.<br><br>Even though I didn’t have the opportunity to try the lounge, it deserves at least a brief mention because it is, I think, what helps to make Fifth Avenue unique amongst Vancouver-area cinemas. Along with being fully licensed to serve alcohol, the lounge also functions as a restaurant with an emphasis on local ingredients (i.e.: “BC”). Here, movie patrons can procure such delights paninis, freshly made salads, artisanal cheese plates, ice cream and classic cookies. All of these items feature ingredients from in and around the Province, which is kind of a neat touch. And beyond the food, the space itself is pretty stylish. It features modern, comfortable chairs; beautiful fireplace; and low-level lighting to really impress upon you the relaxed atmosphere and vibe.<br><br>I don’t really have anything negative to say about this cinema; my overall experience was pretty excellent. Beyond the updated look and comfortable seating throughout, I really appreciate the fact that this Cineplex – unlike most others – seems to pay more attention to “art” films or those that have a limited release. It helps this place to stand out that much more! Highly recommended!</span></div>",

I then received a phone call that due to staff shortage they could not be together so they would be one after the other with my wife going into the appointment first.  We checked out the spa a few hours before the appointment where my wife and daughter filled out the health forms.  My wife and daughter arrived and they were told the aesthetician was running late by 15 min. When she came to call them, the girl called my daughter first even though we were told that my wife would be going first - no big deal just a bit odd.  The girl told my daughter to choose a colour for her hands and feet which she did and my wife also proceeded to pick out a colour. Once the express manicure and pedicure were completed for my daughter the girl turns to my wife and asks if my wife wanted to purchase the nail colour she had chosen for herself.  My wife confused noted that no it was for her pedicure which was to be next.  The girl said ""oh I don't think they checked you in, I'll have to check"".  She proceeds to leave the room holding both my wife and daughters health forms - now why would she have both of the health forms if only my daughter was going to have a spa treatment? She then comes back in and starts the pedicure on my wife.  My wife noted a few things which she felt made this spa less than spa like.  First, when filling up the tub of water to soak your feet in the same room the treatment was taking place - the ""soak"" the girl used for their feet was hand pump soap from the wall that you would find in any restroom!  Another thing is she had both my daughter and wife sitting in an upright position on the ""treatment bed"" with their feet up on the girls lap who barely really even treated the feet.  Leaving both my daughter and wife to have to balance with their legs up to get a pedicure.  Very very unprofessional.  My wife notes she has had better pedicures in the walk in places.  Disappointed!</span></div>",

The difficulty of this room are from the puzzles, not anything that limits your physical ability or anything that is time consuming (ex. not having enough flashlights to go around). We had a good team going into the room and were able to multitask and times when we needed to come together as a group. The puzzles were very well designed that don't require any specific information to solve them, this we were grateful for. There were a lot of tech-y things we saw that we've never seen at other escape rooms, which makes this place really unique! Some of the locking mechanisms I haven't seen before - I asked where they got those locks and they told us they were privately designed and can't be found commercially!!! That's special :) <br><br>Few things I would've liked to see were accessible washrooms from the entrance - that part was odd..There was only one room to choose from, but after trying the room, I can see all the design work that went into this room is top notch. Some decor is lacking and the theme wasn't felt as strongly. I did go around the time it was opened and they did say they were going to put more decor up.<br><br>Personally, I go to an escape room to have a good time solving puzzles and working as a team, and I felt both that here at Esc Key. I also felt appreciated as a guest because you can offer discounts to your friends and get monetary feedback in return - this was interesting too! If you love escape rooms, you gotta try this one!!</span></div>",

Our party of four (two Aussies &amp; two Canadians) had previous experience on sleds at Silver Star and after a couple of phone calls they agreed to the four hour tour.  So glad they did!  The back country was all unbroken trails and both guides Andrew and Trevor were experienced, friendly and had a wicked sense of humour.  Having been to Canada some 9 times, we had never seen a moose.  Andrew made it his mission to find us a ""Swamp Donkey""  Not only did we get to view our very first Antler Cow (Moose) we saw a total of seven of them during our four hours. Mother cows, twin calves, and a bull moose to boot.  The powder was deep, the trails were amazing and the professional experience of the guides was second to none.  We can recommend this experience to anyone. OH!......please tip the guides, they rock!</span></div>",

The location is unbeatable and only minutes from the downtown core / Okanagan Lake.  If you somehow get a morning tee time you will definitely pay for it, but it will probably be worth it.  The course itself is fantastic with a good mix of different holes.  <br><br>It definitely has that old country club feel to it, and in some ways this hurts the reputation but in others it preserves the long history.  Not quite as old as the Vernon Golf and Country Club (est. 1913), but it has many similar elements.  Kelowna is a large city and becoming a member at KGCC is about as tough as it gets in the Okanagan. Might as well call it a private club as the waiting list is years old.  I have heard from many members that the only disappointing aspect is when you are a member, it can be difficult to get tee times because of the sheer amount of members.  <br><br>Food has always been good in the clubhouse and the clubhouse itself is quite beautiful.  In past years, only members and guest could eat there.. (not sure if this is still accurate). If you haven't played KGCC, definitely put it on your list to play in the Okanagan and good luck getting a tee time.</span></div>",

Amazing location for several places to visit.<br>Pyromania Pottery has reasonably priced items from locals.  Also for the more serious collector higher priced items!  I have participated several of their “glaze your own item” workshops every second Saturday early spring and on (just check out Facebook and website for dates and book a time)<br>It is a popular event!  You select an item like a sea star or horse, fish, vase or heart shaped pouch. Pay for your item. Staff demo the glaze Colors and then you make your own choices to apply and create. Then it is fired while you watch and enjoy visiting with other participants and Staff. Homemade cookies and coffee is provided.<br>The Raku Pottery process/experience is an interesting one. Dress warmly as you are outside and good footwear for standing either on the porch or on gravel or lawn and it can take awhile. Also stay back as the kiln is extremely hot!!!  Watch and be amazed as you see your item come alive with the result of your glazes when fired! <br>Best part of all you take it home with you!  <br>Plan a few hours and definitely book your time!  If you aren’t satisfied don’t forget there is a delightful shop so you can always purchase a similar item lol!<br>Make a day of it and visit the other shops and Coombs Country Store,  antiques and Cuckoos Restaurant to name a few all along Alberni Hwy. between Parksville and Qualicum Beach. <br>Looking forward to next Saturday March 10, 2018 my first of the season to make some more Raku.  I enjoy the experience.  Bringing another friend to share this event with!  I make items for gifts for friends that visit us on the island.  Highly recommend making the time to do this.  If you’re visitnf extra special to give away something you made while being on the island!  You might get a time as a walk in and if you can’t items are for sale!  Enjoy!</span></div>",< 1 hour

The bikes come with helmets, locks and a basket (if you need one). The service was great and the owner took a lot of time telling us about the many bike trails available to us, and even rode with us for the first few minutes of our bike trip, telling us some of the history of Vancouver, which was interesting!  The bikes themselves were good quality and in good working order.  What a great city for biking!!  We loved the trail along the seawall and Stanley Park, and even braved the VERY LONG HILL to get to the University of British Columbia! That was the only part of the hike that was strenuous--the rest was nice and flat!  The bike paths were so well thought out, with separate lanes for bikes vs. runners/walkers and totally separated lanes on some streets.  After a full day of biking, when we returned the bikes, the employees were very helpful and provided recommendations on good places in the area for dinner!  Great, friendly service!</span></div>",

Looked after us really well and provided the group with incredible terrain- FRESH POW every run!<br><br>Safety first on the slopes, and the guides looked after everyone very well. <br><br>Around mid afternoon the cat makes a stop at the ""Pizza Shack"", the owner built a hut with a pizza oven in it half way up the mountain. Best Pizza in Valemont!!!!  Two kinds on the menu, and after skiing for 3/4 of the day- it hits the spot!<br><br>Day Two our guides were Barb, Christian, and Graham on a snow board. Yes kids, knuckle draggers are welcome in the back country and we had a full day of shenanigans on the hill. Fresh snow on another part of the mountain,a few Chinese downhills were on tap,  and yes the glorious Pizza!<br><br>By far the best time we have had skiing, both days blue sky, fresh snow, spectacular vistas, tasty Pizza, memories that will last a life time!!!<br><br>Wait a minute I'm and old guy and I forget easy, will have to make it an annual trip !!!!</span></div>",More than 3 hours

I have been getting eyelash extensions for about 4 months or so.. And I usually get it in Victoria, but since I am on salt spring and needed a fill, I went to go to the local spa to do it. (The only one on salt spring that does eyelash extensions). Oh let me tell you, I had a horrible experience and I'm all for supporting local businesses but this is bad. I get to the spa and the person who is going to do my extensions make me wait because she's drinking coffee. The spa also doesn't look like they are busy. I was the only one there. Then, I get into the room and she lies me down on the reclining chair that has so many stains on the cover. When she starts, she doesn't put those white undereye patches or tapes. She tells me to open my eyes during this process. The glue is also stinging my eye and literally smells like nail polish. Within 20 minutes, she tells me she is done and gives me the mirror for me to look. It usually takes 45mins to an hour usually. I have clear glue covered on my lower lashes (which we have not touched for extensions), and all my top lashes are glued together. The lady tells me that they will wash off. It's hard to keep my eyes open and they look horrible. I went to a freakin' spa for this. I didn't go find a cheap place for it nor did I get them from a person who is practicing them. So lesson learned. Do your research before going to get your lashes done.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

I like their soaps, their shower gels, Sympathy for the Skin lotion (has bananas in it), and their body powders.  I have used their Juicy shampoo, Jungle solid conditioner (staff will tell you how to use it), and their face soap.  If you buy a load of stuff from LUSH, the staff should throw in some small samples for you to try...watch out though, LUSH is addictive!  You won't dislike anything that you try!  There are also perfumes, face masks, deoderants, massage bars, pre-packaged gift boxes, and a small line of men's products.  Don't miss LUSH--two stores, one near W 4th (?) and one on Robson.  Shipping to the US is expensive, so stock up while you are there!</span></div>",

She didn't love it, she liked it. But she's not writing the review, I am, so here's my take.<br><br>Basically, it is a collection of toy stores within a mini-mall with a play area on the top floor. Nothing more. Yes, there are lots of toys and a variety of items to buy and poke and feel, but essentially it is like somebody took a Toys R Us and divided into 20 different partitions, and gave each partition a new store name.<br><br>The play area on the top floor was, apparently, lots of fun and my daughter spent a good 45 minutes running around and came out sweating from exertion! The old-style gaming room ain't that - not sure when HD video games were old style... There are some things like whack a mole and things where you can win tickets to trade in for the cheapest most environmentally depressing toys collected anywhere...</span></div>",

It’s standard but, at the same time, relaxing and even kind of “homey.”<br><br>While Galaxy is, for all intents and purposes, your typical Cineplex in both structure and offerings, it nevertheless stands out thanks to its film line-up and auditorium amenities. For example, this cinema does at least pay lip-service to limited release films (like the one we went to see), which we certainly appreciate because it offers up some variety. Furthermore, the auditoriums are a treat: They’ve been upgraded with wide leather reclining chairs; it’s like getting the VIP experience sans the VIP price tag. Best of all, the seats are spaced out enough so as to provide movie-goers with more than enough arm and leg room to fully relax and enjoy their film.<br><br>I cannot speak to the concession amenities other than to say that they’re fairly limited: Yoyo’s, Starbucks and Mini Melts. Popcorn and hot dogs are available as well. If you want something a bit more substantive before the movie, there is a Montanas very close by.<br><br>All in all, we enjoyed our movie experience here. If we happen to be in Nanaimo again while an eye-catching film is playing, we will definitely stop by, kick up our feet and enjoy another movie here. The reclining seats were a nice surprise and enhanced our experience. Thumbs up!</span></div>",

The bus driver was efficient, on time, and safe, but not very friendly.  We used this service to get from the Vancouver cruise pier to SEA-TAC, which means going through border security.  I honestly don't know that Quick Shuttle could have done anything about expediting the process, but the process was very slow. Consequently, we were an hour late from the promised arrival time.  Once we got to the Seattle Convention Center drop-off, everything was quick.  It is not much further to SEA-TAC.  But, prior to that I was worried about missing our flight.  I would use the service again, but allow lots of extra time to make your flight.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

A feeling that is often lost in this modern world. The owner is extremely personable and loves to get to know her customers, and that is evident with things like her word of the day on her chalkboard, courtesy of a regular customer with a big vocabulary. She cares a lot about the community. Her coffee is amazing and it's also pretty awesome knowing she's supporting local suppliers. You can find the most unique items in her store, whether it's vintage or a piece of art or a product from a fellow local business owner. She also has a children's play area to keep the little ones occupied while you shop and sip. You definitely have to add this store to your must-stop-by list when visiting Lake Cowichan.</span></div>",< 1 hour

First time playing the 9 hole Pinnacle course. <br><br>Green fees are $26 which in comparison to other courses in the area is a steal of a deal. I hope they keep these prices, it attracts people to drive out here. <br><br>There are no par 5s, all par 4s under 300 yards and short par 3s. The course itself plays fairly tight although there is room in certain landing areas... Basically all the trouble here comes 100 yards and in. On the par 4s, you can hit a short shot to the fairway and go up and down from 100 and avoid all the trouble. Once you start going for par 4 greens off the tee, you're taking a risk. <br><br>Greens as of October 3 are in post-aeration and are sand covered and bumpy. They roll at a decent pace, but no fast. Can't expect much for post-aeration but they were surprisingly very bumpy... It looks like they play better during the summer. <br><br>Easily walkable, you don't play up hill very often; it's mostly gradual. After playing here for the first time I now know where to hit my shots and where to bail out. 1st hole for example, the play is a long iron or wood over the lake at the green. If you're long you'll just be on #2 tee. <br><br>Overall and pleasant experience. Great value in my opinion for a 9 hole executive. Courses like mission meadows and michaelbrook charge similar and they're boring flat farm courses. I don't think it can be rated as excellent because it's not when comparing all golf courses in the area. The scenery is beautiful here and there are great views of the world renowned Layer Cake Mountain; the only mountain of its kind in the world. <br><br>Scenic Canyon Provincial Park is below along the river as you'll see with the excellent views. </span></div>",1-2 hours

Whether a window shopper or a serious trendsetter, a fashionista or a dabbler, the crowd of independent boutiques, quirky one-off shops, and well-known luxury brands on Robson Street have something to cater for every itch in your wallet. As a result, it draws a diverse crowd, and the people-watching along this famous walking thoroughfare is a primary attraction. In between the clothing shops both high-street and budget-friendly are a number of cafes to lay down your load, as well as numerous specialty stores ranging in their wares from music, to art, to city souvenirs. Known as ""Vancouver's Runway,"" if a new trend is on the rise, you'd spot it here first.</div>",1-2 hours

First and foremost I would like to address why we enforce the pace of play policy. The Greywolf Golf Course is one of the most reputable mountain golf destinations in Canada and we strive for every guest to leave our property with a true mountain golf experience. You mentioned in your review that Mr. Vincent approached your group because you fell behind pace. The reason why we monitor the pace of play is so everyone playing that certain day can enjoy their round instead of waiting to play their round. It is unfortunate that your day seemed to be ruined by our pace of play policy. I will however reimburse your full round, as requested, and will ensure that we continue to inform all of our customers of the pace of play policy moving forward, so everyone playing that day has the best possible mountain golf experience. Please email stuart@greywolfgolf.com to confirm the details of your refund.

Kind Regards,

Dane Thorogood
General Manager

Be sure to leave time to visit the practice facility, even if only for the drive.  Also stop at the Blue or Black tees on hole 15 &amp; 17, just to see the views.  We played from these two tees just to watch our balls fly.  There is a 99yard difference between the Blue and White tee boxes so after we finished the hole we subtracted one stroke and used that for our hole score.  The good news is you no longer have to bring the rake from the cart to clean up the bunkers.  I am not sure when they stopped that practice.</span></div>",

Granville Street, being mostly open to pedestrian-only traffic, has a healthy social life along its main thoroughfares, even outside of its cafes and pubs, spilling onto the sidewalks. The locals are chatty, the shops at its expansive Pacific Centre Mall are trendy, and the whole area seems to be on a sugar rush: in a good way.

It's a thoughtfully designed fun course, especially the back nine which is pretty good.  The front nine is a bit nasty playability wise, and it feels like an overcompensation for the relative ease of the back nine. There are a couple of holes (2 and 5 especially, honorable mention to 11) that are seemingly plugged in just to get from one place to another and to have a total par that adds up to 72.   It's never going to host a serious tournament, that's for sure.  That said, the good and fun holes significantly outnumber the silly ones.<br><br>Played on a Wednesday morning in one of the initial groups out.  Course conditions were excellent, greens were fast and true.  Service was average at best.  <br><br>It's a pretty tight course, so the margins for error aren't generous, on most tee shots and many of the approaches.  What really lacks here are course guides or other information to help you manage your play at the course.  This is especially egregious as many holes are fully or semi blind, so it's critical to have some information to plan your shot.  There is an app, but I'm not at the golf course so that I can have my head in my phone all day.<br><br>Signs at the tees giving yardages to key hazards or landing zones?  Nope! <br>Yardages on sprinkler heads? Nope! <br>Hole map at the tee?  Nope!<br><br>Even my local muni that charges $50/round has this stuff.  So with this and the general lack of hazard stakes it seems like the course is trying to be mysterious and tricky, but it just feels lazy and lacking.  For a course that purports to be premium with prices that reflect that, and is marketed to visitors likely to be playing the course very infrequently, it's inexcusable.  <br><br>Also, there's no permanent clubhouse, and it's clear there's ongoing construction happening with plans for big things. Time will tell how that pans out.<br><br>Honestly, it's a solid 3.5/5.  I can't give it 4/5 simply because the course management has overlooked some really simple things that would make it much more playable and enjoyable, and that don't require any physical course changes.  I'd be happy to play again, but probably not at the top rack rate unless the service and experience was significantly improved.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

Whether a window shopper or a serious trendsetter, a fashionista or a dabbler, the crowd of independent boutiques, quirky one-off shops, and well-known luxury brands on Robson Street have something to cater for every itch in your wallet. As a result, it draws a diverse crowd, and the people-watching along this famous walking thoroughfare is a primary attraction. In between the clothing shops both high-street and budget-friendly are a number of cafes to lay down your load, as well as numerous specialty stores ranging in their wares from music, to art, to city souvenirs. Known as ""Vancouver's Runway,"" if a new trend is on the rise, you'd spot it here first.</div>",

For the water ski lessons he was a total professional (which in the non-English context is a compliment).  He gave them a great lesson on land which did not count towards time and then had both kids up and skiing quite a lot in the 30 minutes.

We have been on the regular theatre as well as the VIP.  The VIP seats are extremely comfortable spacious and recline....they are nice.  You can get drinks (soft and a little harder) delivered to your seat if you want.  It is a pricey ticket and the bevies and food are as well.  I guess it depends if you want nice or really nice!  Personally I think the VIP is a little too over the top for us!  We will continue to, because who does not like to go to the movies, but will probably avoid VIP, if we can!</span></div>",

This was our very first stop early in the evening. Upon our arrival, the staff member of this business was rude, abusive and threatening towards us simply because we were boisterous and were a group of six fairly large men (all professionals) and accused us of being intoxicated (which we were not). We were so taken aback by their extremely unprofessional behavior that we considered leaving on the spot, however, we were then threatened with not having our money refunded. So away we went, forced to spend 90 minutes in an extremely awkward and uncomfortable situation, simply to get our moneys worth. We were not about to throw away $180 for nothing.<br><br>The game itself was boring and the puzzles were really not well thought out. There was so much walking involved it really took the fun out of it as well. We knew it was a scavenger hunt style escape game, however, the game spans over 12 city blocks which is quite a bit of walking. Too much in my opinion.<br><br>The games master that accompanied us was too involved in our game, as if he were part of the group, and kept trying to give us clues rather than let us try to solve the puzzles on our own. He would suggest things like ""look over here"" completely uninvited which kind of ruined that part of the game for us as well.<br><br>Towards the end, we stopped caring if we even solved the game because of the poor execution and still-lingering awkwardness of the initial part of the evening. When I followed up with the owner regarding our experience, he was rude, insulting and threatening towards me as well. Having now read some other reviews about this business, I see we are not the only ones who have had this nearly identical experience.<br><br>I recommend you avoid this business at all costs!</span></div>",1-2 hours

class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">We had planned a visit to Radium to spend time at their pool however we learned that they were closed for renovation of their change rooms and that the anticipate duration of the renovations had been extended.<br>Our hotel indicated that the ones in Fairmont were ""just as nice"" and, more importantly, open so we drove down to see.<br>The hotel did not offer any kind of discount which is something that surprised us a bit thinking that they would have the perfect opportunity to increase the number of visitors to any of the local attractions, simply by offering something.<br>It had been many years since I had been to the Fairmont Hots Springs (and that was in Summer) so, while it looked similar, everything was different.<br>I did remember that to get to the pools, one had to walk down a hill from the parking lot and this was the same and they has sprinkled de-icer to reduce the slipping hazard (something that another person commented had been missing the day before).<br>The man at the entrance seemed extremely ""relaxed"" and asked if we anted a single entry or a day pass.<br>We were slightly confused since the web site indicated that single entry was not available on holidays but, since we had planned to leave for lunch and return, we opted for the day pass despite the fact that it was $4 more per person.<br>Once through the gate, the men's change room was to the left and the women's down one flight of stairs to the right.<br>There are signs indicating that showers are mandatory however, there were several people who decided that the rules do not apply to them.<br>Once through the showers, the exit door leads back to the same walkway (outside) which leads down another set of stairs to the pool area.<br>The surface of the concrete is extremely rough on bare feet which is something that many of the other guests commented on too.<br>If one is planning to enjoy the Fairmont pools, slippers/flip-flops would be recommended to prevent this ""irritation"".<br>One immediately notices the steam rising from the pools and it looks extremely inviting.<br>The web site indicates that one pool is warmer than the other however there are no signs to say which is which so we chose to enter the one with the most people.<br>They have a ramp to enter each pool with a hand rail and it was fun to see ice forming on the handrail but the pool felt incredibly warm.<br>The hotter pool is not very deep (perhaps 2.5 feet) so almost everyone was sitting on the floor or on the ""benches"" that were built into the pool.<br>There was an ""island"" in the middle from which 3-4 jets pumped the hot water into the pool.<br>The jets were quite hot, hot enough that no one actually left any extremity in from of them and many people commented on how hot they were.<br>There are signs suggesting that one should limit their time in the pool to 20 minutes so we stayed for a while then tried out the larger pool.<br>It was deeper and cooler than the first one with fewer people in it.<br>Walking back and forth was great therapy for sore ankles and knees.<br>There was a deeper ""diving tank"" however, because of the hazards of slippery ice in the winter, the boards had been removed.<br>This did not prevent several children from enjoying diving/jumping in off the edges and enjoying themselves immensely.<br>There were two lifeguards walking around the perimeter all bundled up for the cool wind but ready at a moment's notice.<br>We asked one of them about a contraption on the south wall and he explained that it s sort of a zip line that is operated in the Summer.<br>Kids can grab onto the line and swing out over the pool and drop into the water.<br>It was not in service now but looked kind of fun for young children.<br>There were signs prohibiting climbing over the walls between pools and the lifeguards spent a fair amount of time reminding people not to do so.<br>There were also signs suggesting that people should not leave their belongings on the lawn chairs which did not seem to be a problem (since it was Winter) as the chairs had been stored away.<br>The longer we stayed in the pools, the more apparent the coldness of the wind became.<br>It was sort of funny to see ice forming on the hair of others when one cold not really feel it on one's self.<br>It was only when one touched their head/hair/ears that one realized how cold the exposed part were getting.<br>All in all, the 2.5 hours we spent there were very enjoyable and we felt refreshed when we left.<br>I remembered being able to drive across to the RV area and watching the water from the poos cascading down the cliff however the roadway  looked very icy with no tracks to indicate others had risked the view.<br>We stopped into the Resort to ask about room rates and discovered that the whatever room rate one decides upon, unlimited access to the pools is included which is a significant savings in itself.<br>We did discover that with the Auto Club Discount, the Fairmont Resort offers rates competitive to those available in Radium and when the free pool admission is factored in, a much better value.<br>Next visit will will avoid the BW Prestige in Radium and try the Fairmont Resort instead.<br>The Fairmont Resort also offers a midweek discount price as well and the property is lovely and very quiet.<br>The access road is a fair distance away from the main highway so there is little traffic noise either.<br>I am sorry that I did not think to take pictures before getting changed and was too relaxed to think of it afterwards.<br>I was surprised to see how many people brought their phones with them down to the pools but they were able to get lots of pictures to remember the outing</span></div>",1-2

Upon arrival we were greeted with a very long line up of carts and golfers waiting to tee off. Pro shop advised that it was first-come, first-served as their computer had gone down and they had no record of any tee times. We were told to simply ""get in line"" with no other options.  ( We were not the only foursome that was disappointed that their previously booked tee times were not honoured.) We appreciate that computers will crash however we were told by other golfers that that they were advised  on the Wednesday (two days before the computer crash) that Frriday would be a ""first come first serve basis"".  Interesting !  Hope this was an isolated incident as clearly no way to run a golf course business.</span></div>",

Not a great start.<br>So I had to wait outside the float room, while the previous occupant finished, and then they took about 1 minute to (presumably) clean the room.  About 45 minutes into my float, I couldn't help but notice a large clump of hair floating in the pool.  I then left my float early, and ran to take an extra long shower.<br>It's a nice enough spa, and the grounds around it are lovely.

Its youthful vibe owes to the many young families and young professionals who live there, bolstering nightlife and restaurant variety along its cobbled streets. It is the flagship neighbourhood for modern revitalization, and the It-Spot for boutique hotels and modish eats.</div>",

I paid 55 for twilight and then was charged 22 for a cart cause I was single.  So all in was 77.  Way too much for a course of this shape.  <br><br>I would also note the course guide is not up to date.  There are bunkers on the course that are not in the guide.  How serious of a place is this when they can't even get that simple thing done.  <br><br>Also you probably have played courses that you kind of have that ""wow"" factor when you get to the driveway and you think this is gonna be a great golf experience.  This course did not have that.  <br><br>If you are only in the area , no real choice but to play this one, if not I would look elsewhere for sure.

Granville Street, being mostly open to pedestrian-only traffic, has a healthy social life along its main thoroughfares, even outside of its cafes and pubs, spilling onto the sidewalks.

If in the area, or in Qualicum Beach this is a must go!  The prices are fabulous and the food and service are outstanding!

The place responsible for originating of the phrase 'skid row' might not call to mind independently-owned boutiques and terraced cafes, but having swallowed the waterfront lines of False Creek North, the resulting amalgamation transformed the area into an elegant, stylish hotspot with a view. Its youthful vibe owes to the many young families and young professionals who live there, bolstering nightlife and restaurant variety along its cobbled streets. It is the flagship neighbourhood for modern revitalization, and the It-Spot for boutique hotels and modish eats.</div>",< 1 hour

Would recommed this ride for people who have a little experience some of the trails got quite narrow and a little scary. The horses had it all under control though.</span></div>",

The total distance to cycle the route is 12km each way (24km) total. Over the years of running this operation we have found that the majority of our clients take around 4 hours to do the complete route and we manage our bookings accordingly so that the maximum number of visitors can enjoy the experience.

 Our costs  are based on transporting all the bikes up from Kelowna daily and being on the site come rain or shine every day of the season with at least two staff members, regardless how many people visit. 
Our prices are the cheapest available.

Jamie was amazing right from booking through to her excellent how-to demo and even the drop off process at day’s end. I hadn’t ridden a scooter before and was a little apprehensive, but thanks to Jamie’s encouragement and thorough teaching, she helped give me the confidence I needed to get over my nervousness and get out on the road and have fun. <br>Once I was on the road for a bit, and relaxed, it was so awesome. I found the trickiest part was turning(you’ve got to lean into it!), but after a bit of practice, it got a lot easier. Bowen is the perfect place for scooter riding as the speed limit throughout the island is 40 km/hr or less, which is about as fast as the scooter will go. We ended our day at the Cape- so gorgeous- I’d highly suggest going. We had such a fabulous time, I’ll definitely be back again and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend ZoomZoom to anyone who can ride a bike.</span></div>",2-3 hours

We chose the Zombie Apocalypse theme. What an experience! It challenged you to think differently and problem solve in a unique and entertaining way. We had so much fun trying to solve the clues and make our way through the rooms. <br><br>It was just the two of us which was perfect (in my opinion). I feel like if there was 8 people (the maximum allowed) there would be ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" and it would take more time to figure the clues out. However, on the flip side it's beneficial to have people with different thinking styles. I would say the ideal maximum number of people for this room would be 4.<br><br>We found out that the success rate for the Z Apocalypse was only 1% (it is one of the more difficult rooms). We made it to the third room with only minutes to spare and 1 clue (out of 3) left. Once the time is up they allow you to continue the same challenge for another 45 minutes or come back to try and complete the same challenge for 1/2 price.<br><br>I would 100% recommend this to to everyone. It's a completely unique and different experience and a fun way to spend time with friends, family and even co-workers! <br><br>I am going to suggest this to my office as a team-building exercise!</span></div>",

Unfortunately, this was hardly the case when visiting Ballet BC at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre.  To my utter shock, the attendant was quick to interrogate me in a smug and demeaning manner for wishing to go to the washroom but selectively chose to ignore the four couples who talked incessantly throughout the performance - all within the attendants ear shot.  I even watched three other Queen Elizabeth staff actually laugh at a patron attempting to exit through the wrong door.  When people pay such prices - their disregard is utterly inexcusable.  Coupled with a pompous attitude and general malaise - it becomes increasingly clear why the arts are suffering when their frontline staff have little to no regard for paying customers.  I would strongly recommend within a city with plenty of competitive shows and quality venues - to avoid QE and spend your money elsewhere.</span></div>",

Stained glass windows and antique curved wood pews, huge pipe organ and top balcony. The Music was a wonderful blend of hymns and contemporary Christian. The choir was awesome. The entire Service was a sweet blessing start to finish. If you get a chance, worship with these precious folks! (Providentially no one was seriously injured in the car accident!)</span></div>",

There are reserved seats for the concerts which cost $, so we were ok to stand for free. I went inside at 6:30pm while my husband got us dinner. At about 6:45pm they said that they weren't letting anyone else into the concert at all--even if they had family members or children inside saving them a seat. <br><br>I talked to 3 security guards,and was told the venue was at capacity (even though there was plenty of standing room).They said nobody was being let in without a re-entry stamp--but again there was LOTS of room still. <br><br>I understand that they have to follow firecode, but there were no signs posted at the PNE entrance or concert gate that warned guests that their families might be seperated without notice or that they needed re-entry stamps. The staff didn't seem to care at all that they were seperating families that couldn't find each other in a huge crowd.<br><br>I entered the gates 1.5 hours before the ""free"" concert and ended up leaving 15 minutes before it started because they wouldn't let my husband inside even though there was room. I saw lots of families leaving the concert simply because half of the family was inside and half was outside and couldn't get into the concert.<br><br>Furthermore, cell phone reception inside the concert and the PNE was horrible--families should set up a meeting spot ahead of time becaues texts and calls didn't go through.<br><br>I understand that the concerts are ""free"" with admission, but PNE organizers need to do a better job of crowd management in informing people that in order to get into the free concert you have to be there at at least 5pm for a 8pm concert! Again, I've never seen the PNE this crowded and unorganized in the past 7 years. <br><br>Also, the game of thrones exhibit was fulll and you needed a ticket to get into it (NOT advertised at all). <br><br>It wasn't fun to be herded like cattle and treated poorly by the staff.

This means you don't have a full day onsite even though you pay for it.  <br><br>Another irksome thing is the eight dollar charge to make a reservation.  If you are only staying one night it means a 38 dollar charge for a 20 hours stay.  Why is this charge necessary? Because they contract reservations to a third party company.  <br><br>It is impossible to change a reservation via the internet as there is no link to do so.  This means another phone call which goes unanswered until they get around to it.  Even then, when specificaly asked to return the call because you need to make a change they don't.<br><br>Then you get an email stating your reservations have been cancelled so this means another call, which again goes unanswered until sometime  the next day, so you can make the changes necessary.<br><br>This lack of regard for people's time is unacceptable.  If they would simply initiate a better booking system (like having someone actually answer the dam phone) it would be much more efficient and less costly to their clients.  The eight dollar booking charge could be applied to someone's wages to man a phone and take care of clients properly.<br><br>The staff (mostly millennials) are slow moving and seemingly could care less about anything except their social life. They mostly sit around the office chatting with each other and do very little actual work.  Noxious weeds (which they supposedly control by hand picking to avoid spray) are flourishing and going to seed which insures lots of work for them next year.<br><br>The whole experience is frustrating for someone who has spent their working life being time conscious and committed  to customer service.<br><br>Next time in Logan Lake I will find a place in the bush so I won't need to deal with this incompetence and lack of regard for clients.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

We were headed to a Symphony winery and saw the sign for this place so we decided to stop in, once we realized symphony was not open for the summer yet.  I am so glad symphony was closed and we took a chance on Rathjen.<br><br>The exterior looks a bit bland, but once inside, it is a nice simple  tasting room with a bit of an industrial feel.  The wood on the tasting table was beautiful and the metal rolling racks they made for the wine displays were quite cool.<br><br>Turns out, the person pouring the wine happened to be the wine maker, which was super fun.  Fun fact: Rathjen is his last name.  We tasted 7 wines and were very impressed with their Rosé and Pinot Noir that we took both home with us.  We were also super intrigued by the Vermouth and the Creme de Cassis, both were delicious in their own way, and quite unique.  The vermouth was so beautifully floral and mild, and the creme de cassis was full of flavor without being overly sweet.  While I wanted to take both home, we knew we didn’t have room for both in our suitcase home, so we settled on a bottle of the creme de cassis since it was small and we figured we’d use it more.<br><br>I think these people are making wine right, and will do very well as they grow and continue to make wine.</span></div>",< 1 hour

It is right on the water -- I happened upon it when I went to visit a Crossfit Gym in the area and they were closed unexpectedly. You have Olympic Village, Rogers Arena, Science Museum and Yaletown that intersect along the path. I recommend trying to do the full walk. You get a great view of the City this way, with a bike path, walking path and it is very family friendly. Looks like they have canoes and boats available during the warmer months that you can use too.</span></div>",

Just over the Fraser River from Boston Bar, B.C. is the beautiful Nahatlatch River.   Three friends and I spent two nights at Reo's lodge on the river, sleeping soundly with the lovely sound of the river running close by our tents.  I recommend staying in the ""cabin/tents"", as a bed after a day of rafting is most welcome!  Showers, washrooms, great food and a warm campfire were also welcome.  However, the white water rafting was what we were there for!  Great guides taught well what we needed to know, then we donned wet suits, helmets and a very good attitude and off we went into the wild water!  We loved it so much, we did it Saturday and Sunday mornings.  This is a MUST for everyone's bucket lists.  I intend to go again - soon!  Great for couples, family, business groups, friends or solo!</span></div>",

As mentioned in the previous review we also drove past the first parking lot before realizing it.  The signage is poor and only a small sign at the back of the parking lot, not on the road.  The parking lot was full of huge holes.  The walk from the second parking lot to the marsh was very short and once at the marsh there was really nothing to see but a couple of geese.  We tried to find if there was any additional walking paths as there were a lot of small trails but they were not well used enough to walk on.  We had expected to see more birds, and wildlife at the marsh.</span></div>",< 1 hour

I suspect there are at least a few reasons for this: 1) Prospect Point Lighthouse isn’t quite as picturesque (its location could make taking photos a bit more difficult); and, 2) It isn’t as readily accessible. Whereas Brockton Point Lighthouse can be easily reached via Park Drive or the Seawall, Prospect Point Lighthouse can only be reached via a relatively (short) walk along the Seawall. If one were to park at or near Prospect Point Lookout, just walk down to the Seawall from there – heading west – and you’ll eventually come across the lighthouse. Finally, 3) Prospect Point Lighthouse isn’t quite as historic. Indeed, while a lighthouse has guided ships here since 1888, the current structure is relatively “new,” having been built in 1948. Compare that to the Brockton Point Lighthouse, which was built in 1914. I know that’s just a 34-year difference, but we can be fickle creatures at times ;)<br><br>In any event, the Prospect Point Lighthouse does carry a significant history and we should respect it for that. Its presence illustrates, for us, the importance of Vancouver as a port city on the west coast.<br><br>If you’re walking along the Stanley Park Seawall and come across this lovely beacon of light, please do take the time to read the information boards prior to taking a selfie!</span></div>",

If you are visiting Vancouver, I would suggest walking or at the very least driving over the Granville Street Bridge. It offers arguably the best views of Vancouver.</span></div>",

It is a very short street which dead ends at a commemorative bell and tribute to a Chinese community matriarch:  Lilian To was her name.  Shanghai Alley is undergoing a renaming process to become Lilian To Way.<br><br>Back in its early days, the Chinese workers lived here but it was also had an opium factory and a red light district.

The museum is run by volunteers from the Native Daughters of B.C.  The collection, much of which has been donated, has a number of First Nations baskets,  It also contains a variety of historical photos and household and children's items.  The collection includes a full size hansom carriage as well as a fare box from a transit bus (scary when your childhood becomes ""historical"")  There is a copy of the original petition for Vancouver's incorporation as well as the original Council table.  Entrance is by donation.  The museum staff also sell a variety of historical books and oddly but interestingly a collection of vintage jewellery  (cash only),  They also fund raise with used books in the foyer if you find yourself on the beach with nothing to read.

I always hesitate to assume it will be spectacular and tend to prepare for total disappointment.  It is, after all, my most favourite opera and I've seen it many, many times from childhood in the Netherlands, to the last performance I saw in Toronto in the mid 1980s.  That last one was a devastating disappointment.  Poorly designed, dull, mediocre performances, and horrors, the libretto changed from Mozart's own choice of German and concession to a version in Italian, to the translation in English.<br><br>Language is an extension of sound.  Some languages are more musical and other's less.  English, to my mind is far less musical than German.  It might have been more suited to translation into the other official language in this country ""French.""  Since that performance I've not seen it performed, staying with the several versions I have of it in CDs.  <br><br>Let it be said that I do favour the bold mounting of new productions, always exploring how old can be new again.  Personally I've always wanted to see Cirque du Soleil tackle this opera with a massive chorus and orchestra, and lithe feathered dancers and acrobats and illusions and sparkle to take me away from this physical plain to another place where magic and morality are paraded about to the most heavenly of musical scores.<br><br>Could one be less prepared?  On entering the lobby of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre it dawned on me suddenly that this would not in any way shape or form be an expected performance.  Apparently it was done incorporating the artistic visions of the aboriginal peoples of the province.  Fine, definitely this would be different.  I like different, as long as certain aspects of the original work are respected.  I am still reeling from the German to English translation.<br><br>If there was any opera suited to using an aboriginal context this is it.  It is all magic and values we universally hold high.  The only thing was Mozart loved his German language, I doubt he's have approved of the translation to English, unlike Italian not a very musical language.  Then too this production added in Musqueam terms/phrases here and there.  Personally if they were going to do a translation, they might as well have gone the entire way with it in Musqueam.  The original libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder required no changes to bring to an aboriginal context other than an inspired staging. I am no fan of having the subtitles dangled above the stage either, it is a distraction.  A well performed and directed opera has no need of subtitles, the outline in the program should be sufficient.<br><br>The voices were all superb, although Mr. Short sounded as if he were battling a cold, and his demeanour more the bearing of a starship captain than a god.  Papageno was indeed a jester but seemed to lack a believable relationship with Tamino, not helped by static scene changes and a lack of Business between the two characters.<br><br>The production itself was jarring. The costuming was incoherent ranging from the hero Tamino in black pants and turtleneck with a tan leather jacket, and Pamina in black leather pants and jacket with a spaghetti-strapped blue sating top, banal.  Inexplicably after the Queen of the Night's ladies were introduced looking out of place with their bald blue heads (reminding me of some show with men painted blue) and aboriginal inspired costume, we were presented with a near baroque costumed Queen, undisputed the highlight as she angrily strutted about the stage, also bald headed in silver.  It took away from Ms. Hyung brilliant performance flawlessly executing one of opera's most acrobatic arias. I was spending less time enjoying the pageant than questioning the reasoning behind this incongruous garb.<br><br>Spirits in unitards flitted about just occasionally (not nearly enough).  Choreography was a little lacklustre and failed to use Mozart's score in favour of silent dance and light drumbeats.  There were wobbles by one dancer while crossing the stage alone and with little else (music, pageant, illusion) to take one's attention it was yet one more annoyance.  Drumbeat, by the way, electronically produced, which were either poorly reproduced or the theatre needs to look at their speakers.  I cannot be convinced that a fairy tale, whether aboriginal or Austrian shouldn't evoke images of spirits flitting about, in the shadows, above, below.  Great feathered birds for Papageno to chase, oh how I kept hoping for some birds and not just the ones carried about by dancers on sticks.  I've seen far more feathers at any pow-wow than in this production which just screams for birds and feathers, and if drums, real drums, perhaps beside the one lone timpanist.<br><br>It was interesting to see projected city images on the curtains during the overture, but the projections here and there during the performance were an annoyance, but might have been better used to mask scene changes rather than the lengthy lowering and raising of curtains and puling and pushing of massive scenery between scenes.  Surely it could have been done more ingeniously with lighting to pull ones attention away and continue the performance as the scenes changed.  It would have taken a good many minutes less than the near two hours of sitting in the Queen Elizabeth's uncomfortable seats.<br><br>The orchestra was too few in number, sounding thin. The chorus, like the orchestra was too thin for the size and scope of this production.   It screamed for more voices, more tympani more woodwinds.  As a teenager I was allowed to play with the local symphony as part of a performance study program, which happily also swelled the number of musicians for larger production.  Surely in Vancouver we have youthful talents who could use the experience to perform alongside, as apprentices perhaps with both symphony and chorus?  <br><br>Could we not have enticed more dancers or extras to swell the inhabitants of the strange land's fairies spirits and other magical creatures?  Is it too much to ask for more birds for Papageno to chase?  Could our her and heroine have something more imaginative to wear than the banal everyday street wear? Aboriginal lore has every bit as much magic and imagination as the Austrian but this performance had very little magic and instead left us with a dullish morality play with artful but incongruent costuming, and sets with projections punctuated by a computer error screen during a scene change.<br><br>The concept is worth working on for future seasons, but please give the audience more magic and fewer dead spots and bald blue women.  In future could the audience refrain from getting up before the house lights are turned on, this is such rude behaviour.  The budget should also include bouquets for the performers, it is only decent.<br><br>aletta mes<br></span></div>",

It's nice to come to this area on Main Street, but it offers a very small sampling of the buisnesses owned and operated by the East Indian community in Vancouver (I'd say the same of Chinatown). It's worth going to, but you'll get a richer sampling of foods and services dispersed throughout Vancouver, Surrey and New Westminster than is offered in this area. The restaurants that I've been to here are fine, but I haven't found one that was so amazing that I'd go out of my way to go back. One or two are mediocre in comparison to the other incredible Indian restaurants we have in the Vancouver Lower Mainland area. Still, it is worth the trip and worth returning to. It just wouldn't be the first place I'd go if I were visiting Vancouver and I had limited time.</span></div>",

The very friendly staff encouraged our participation in the interactive activities. By completing an electronic large screen questionnaire, I learned a few new things! The staff was also very willing to share added tidbits about the exhibits and the town. <br>The location of this museum is ideal, in lovely downtown Port Coquitlam, and is steps away from the cenotaph, city hall and Port Coquitlam's Gathering Place.

That being said, as a villager, I prefer to buy my produce where I won't be charged such high prices! We are told that the produce is local, but having sat at the window tables of the Buck Cafe and witnessed Sunday morning trucks unloading their cases of US produce, one really has to wonder. All told, it is a good destination for a day of fun in Steveston.</span></div>",1-2 hours

We learned that this building is the only brick-faced one in town.  It is the present-day  home to the Journal as well as the Museum.  Not only are these building sitting side-by-side on 4th and Brink Streets but they are made from very different materials:  one is brick and the other, Spanish stucco.  I hope to return one day to see inside of the Museum and learn more about Ashcroft's place in the history of the region.</span></div>",

And we still needed to walk to the brewery from our hotel downtown... lol!  It was a fast walk!  We arrived at 5:25, and ordered their last sampler.  Another restriction from the lack of a liquor license, they don't serve full pints, just samplers.   And is one of the reasons their tasting room is so small.

While visiting family at Twin Lakes we were invited to try samples of TopShelf wines at a tasting at Twin Lakes Market. The gentleman doing the the tasting was Leonard ( one of the owners of the winery). We tried samples of their Over The Top Merlot, Point Shot Pinot Gris and their Slapshot Chardonay. All three were excellent but the Merlot and Chardonay stood out. I and my wife are primarily red wine drinkers and this Merlot was very soft on the tongue and quite enjoyable. Now Chardonay as a rule is not my favorite white wine choice (Pinot Grigio generally is) but in this case we both thoroughly enjoyed it and in fact bought a bottle along with one of the Merlot to bring home. We'll be joining good friends in September to do a self guided winery tour in the Osoyoos, Oliver , Keledan area and plan on making TopShelf one of our stops. Thanks Leonard for your friendly and courteous tasting experience!</span></div>",

However, the quality of our farm produce &amp; artisan products is fantastic! Local farmers provide fresh field greens, not hot house, as our seasonal weather permits. Prepared foods are not factory made, but delicious and hand-made with care. This May it has been cold in the Fraser Valley, therefore we expect that June will be the first month for abundant produce, both vegetables &amp; fruits. We urge our regular buyers to come early, since most of our fresh produce and fresh cut field flowers, like peonies, are taken by early and enthusiastic shoppers. On May 26th, the date of this very negative entry, we had over thirty local vendors with a wonderful selection of fresh produce from our local farmers, prepared foods, wines, spirits &amp; craft beer tastings, and a great selection of BC Artisan work including some fantastic wood-carving art &amp; hand made jewelry.
Also, visitors will be able to stroll through the historic village of Fort Langley, visit the National Historic Fort, and enjoy the many shops &amp; attractions including a great selection of restaurants, coffee shops, antique stores, and much more. Every week there is something new and interesting at the market and in the Village of Fort Langley. On July 29th, there is a fantastic Jazz &amp; Arts Festival in Fort Langley, including a New Orleans style street jazz band, that starts at the Farmers Market and wends its way down around the village of Fort Langley.

The town's archives and information about and photographs of Port Alberni people, both First Nations and settlers/immigrants, are online and make fascinating reading. Most of the collection has been donated by local people and illustrate day to day Alberni Valley in the past.<br>It is a good place<br>   to take a curious child or newcomer to western Canada. There is an amazing collection of baskets woven by local First Nations people, clothing from the past stored in display drawers, logging equipment and hand-made miniatures of houses, horse-drawn vehicles etc. all of which interested me. We could easily have spent a whole day here to study all the collection, but we only had 90 minutes.<br>There is a temporary exhibit on piracy with interesting information about local pirates and rum runners! I noticed very reasonable prices in the little gift store especially for Tee-shirts. I wish they had postcards of some of the artifacts such as the miniatures or the baskets.<br>The museum is in a lovely complex which incudes a swimming pool and a library.<br>Allow one hour for a child's visit and one to two or more if you are interested in history.<br>Admission is by donation, so you can't beat the price.</span></div>",

Before I could finish explaining she interrupted and said waiving her arm ""Off you go!""<br>We left.<br>One would think after the flood and businesses suffering with the lack of tourist the ""city park ambassador"" would be a little bit friendlier. <br>Next time we'll stop in Christina Lake or keep driving through.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

Depending on your preference and level of interest, you could easily spend anywhere from 10 minutes to in excess of an hour at this little gem. The museum documents, in almost painstaking detail, Rupert's fire history from the early 1900s to the present day. Of particular interest to most  are two fire vehicles occasionally displayed outdoors: the 1925 REO Speedwagon fire truck (often described as the ""centre piece"" of the museum) and the completely restored 1958 American LaFrance pumper truck. With regard to the latter, if you happen to be in Prince Rupert during Sea Fest, you'll get to see it participating in the annual parade. Quite the sight!<br><br>Admission to this little museum is free (and by donation). If you have an interest in local history; fire departments and their evolution; or just need to kill some time, then you may want to consider checking this place out.</span></div>",

The museum has a few explanatory signs but is mostly photos, often accompanied by quotes of Japanese Canadians who were sent to Kaslo, either visual or audio. It was interesting to learn that unlike in the US, there was no barbed wire. On the other hand, the buildings that housed the internees had been more or less abandoned at least two decades before, so were in terrible shape, which must have been very uncomfortable considering how cold the winters are. The internees outnumbered the Kaslo residents by more than 2-1 and after the war, at least a few returned to live in Kaslo. Alas, unlike US JAs, Japanese Canadian internees, post war, had to reither return to Japan or go east. They could not return to western BC. As a result, those who chose to remain in Canada are dispersed throughout that country. All in all, a nice museum on what I assume is a relatively small budget.</span></div>",

There tends to be exhibitions throughout the year. And a though separate business, the Blue Toque is a popular place to great breakfast in the morning.<br></span></div>",< 1 hour

The turnoff from Columbia Street is just before it turns right onto Brunette Ave.  It is down and a sharp right turn.  You will see the park gate.  Follow the narrow and at times one way road that runs parallel to the railroad tracks.  Parking can be at a premium as there are only three pull-outs with parking for approximately four vehicles each.  At the last one, there is a portable toilet.  Now that you have finally arrived, you can walk or ride on the flat crushed rock pathways, note:( bikes are not allowed on the paths but can be ridden the the paved access road) and enjoy the use of several benches,  river pop-outs, or the covered picnic area. Bring your camera as the open views of the river and mountains are beautiful.  If you have a license, you can bring your rod and reel and maybe bring home your diner.

All I can say is the food, service and beverages were incredible and cant wait to come back and would highly reccomend. Chef Brock, kitchen staff and front of house (at the time Ben &amp; Connor) made it a true local experience. Kudos to all! I tried both features, (Ribs were full of flavour featuring lavendar and cornbread and the in house cured salmon (sockeye gravlax) with golden raspberry, apricot and savory house made crackers balanced perfectly) I ordered an additional salmon spread just to take home. </span></div>",

However, when we returned for an adjustment, our experience was far better than our first and the service was above our expectations. It definitely is a cozy winery with very enjoyable wines.

Found it through Tripadvisor, and it is a hidden gem. It's quiet, I didn't encounter more than 3 people on the trail. It is mostly uphill but didn't take more than 20-30 mins to get to the top. Took more time to come down to avoid slipping on rocks or roots. Stunning views from the top and and like another reviewer wrote, blissfully quiet unlike Goldstream. I did end up turning on Millstream Lake Road rather than continuing left onto Millstream Road to get to the park and had to turn around. It would have been helpful to have a sign at the fork in the road so it wasn't confusing. Otherwise a wonderful afternoon excursion. There is an outhouse before you start climbing.</span></div>",

Workers miserable, unfriendly, don’t offer to help or seem bothered when you actually ask a question or about the products. Nothing proprietary- most of the foods you can find in many other stores with much better customer service. The view is nice but they don’t let you enjoy it. If you step in the wrong direction they sure let you know about it. You feel unwelcome and as if you are trespassing. Seems they don’t want (or appreciate) your business. Won’t be going back.

It sounded interesting, but was not what I was expecting when I got there.  Lorenzo and John were our bus driver and tour guide, and I enjoyed them very much.  John was very knowledgeable and gave us a great tour of the city of Victoria on the way to the observatory, so that part I would recommend.  However, the observatory itself was very primitive and small, and not really a tourist attraction like I was expecting.  If you are into astronomy, you would probably like it, but for the average tourist of Victoria, I would tell you to pick a different tour of the city instead.</span></div>",1-2 hours

The place responsible for originating of the phrase 'skid row' might not call to mind independently-owned boutiques and terraced cafes, but having swallowed the waterfront lines of False Creek North, the resulting amalgamation transformed the area into an elegant, stylish hotspot with a view. Its youthful vibe owes to the many young families and young professionals who live there, bolstering nightlife and restaurant variety along its cobbled streets.

Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular and lively, with young revelers taking to the streets in droves and keeping the party going until late. Granville Street, being mostly open to pedestrian-only traffic, has a healthy social life along its main thoroughfares, even outside of its cafes and pubs, spilling onto the sidewalks. The locals are chatty, the shops at its expansive Pacific Centre Mall are trendy, and the whole area seems to be on a sugar rush: in a good way.

Walking Trails,3.5,Hiking Trails,11,#14 of 18 things to do in Dawson Creek,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">Lots of walking trails given the small area of Dawson Creek.  The Dawson Trail in Kin Park is lovely, and the city even keeps the main walk cleared of snow in the middle of winter.  Very pretty, whether summer or a -20 (if you're dressed warmly enough to enjoy it!).  Would not recommend part of Dawson Trail that extends out of Kin Park, and behind the mall.  Summer 2013 It is/was unkept, damaged, and rough making the trail unclear and difficult to pass through at one point.  Until fixed and thus frequented with more people traffic, it is possible you might run into an animal that has made it home (I could smell bear, summer 2013, beat it out of there, and was later told one was living in it - thank goodness for olefactary senses!). Now, the Dawson Trail in Kin Park also extends in the opposite direction as well (SW), and this will eventually lead you to the Rotary Trail. The trail does break up, take a jog or two and without consistent signage it does seem to disappear at one point, but use google maps or ask someone.  It's nice once you find your way.   <br>The Rotary trail is a good exercising walk, or run, with a lovely big sky, big field view.   It should take you near ""Rotary Lake"" (pool, not a big lake) near one of the main RV sites and the golf club if you go the distance from Kin Park.  This trail does get a little secluded and less travelled, so go with someone if you are uncomfortable with that.  <br>Another lovely set of trails is Leoppky park.  With some treed, bushy areas you get a bit of a forested sense.  The brush does block the line of sight from the parking lot and surrounding homes.  </span></div>",

The 8 hour tour (May 29, 2019) took us to Cape Scott Provincial Park, San Josef Bay. Absolutely stunning scenery. The owner/tour guide Chris was a fantastic guide giving us lots of history of the island. He had a wealth of knowledge about many stops we made along the way including a historical botanical garden called “The Bernt Ronning Garden”. His co-worker Leah also was very informative about the plants and vegetation. The tour included a delicious lunch with sandwiches made from the best homemade bread along with many other goodies, all from a local deli. Thumbs up to Cove Adventures, I would highly recommend the company to any tourist.</span></div>",

The term ""Lions Gate"" refers to The Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver. Northbound traffic on the bridge heads in their general direction. A pair of cast concrete lions were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January 1939 hence its name.<br>It opened to traffic on November 14, 1938 and on  May 29, 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (the current Queen's Mother) presided over the official opening during a royal visit to Canada.</span></div>",

Mountain Goats and water falls on Morice Lake. And that's just one lake....there are several lakes up there to choose from.

Rossland was a classic mining town, pure and simple---which in recent years has become a trendy ""thriving ghost town"", because of the nearby Red Mountain Ski resort.  The Museum, per se, exhibits are very well done. The larger exhibits are about life in the historic mining town of Rossland, local skiing, and the hydroelectric plant, and a little about the Cominco mining company (which operates the nearby Trail Smelter) and other local mining history.  These are not so disparate topics as they may seem at first.  Skiing was developed by miners (weekend skiers) riding the aerial tram buckets of the mines.  The cheap power of the hydroelectric plant is what made the Trail smelter (which smelted the ore mined in Rossland) possible, and ultimately a great success.  Unfortunately the geology/mining exhibits (on the hill above the museum buildings) were semi-closed when I visited.  Also unfortunately ,many of the outdoor exhibits are in individual sheds “walled” with chain-link fencing – so you can’t really get a good view of the artifacts (vehicles, large compressors, pumps, etc) being displayed.</span></div>",1-2 hours

There's a road that goes up behind it - Lemo Road - but this is a private Reserve Land road. There's a pullout and a bus shelter on Tzouhalem Road itself, below the church - I'm told this is where you're supposed to park and walk up, but last time I drove by the pullout was blocked off to vehicles. If you do walk up to the church, be respectful of the owners of the land and don't stray from the immediate area of the site itself - in other words, don't snoop in peoples yards or be loud and obnoxious. (However, don't be intimidated by threats; last time I was there, a local resident confronted me and claimed that cameras had photographed me and I would be issued with a $480 fine - that's simply not true, in fact the law states that ""trespass on reserve"" carries a maximum fine of $50, and I've never heard of it being enforced in this place. His issue appeared to be with my driving up on Lemo Road - at the time, I was unaware that this road was not a public one.) The building itself has no windows or doors; it is a stone shell that has not been used as a church since the 1800s. Sadly there's quite a lot of graffiti and vandalism damage, but the stone structure survives and the views of the bay from the site are excellent. This is the oldest structure of its kind in the entire Cowichan Valley.</span></div>",< 1 hour

In the Shushwap,  this rest area is open 24 hours a day with plenty of parking designated especially for RV'S and another for passenger cars.  The surrounding scenery is beautiful with a fast-moving river and high mountain peaks.  Picnic tables, clean washrooms, garbage cans and a dog walking area are available for travellers.  We followed a scenic trail searching for a geocache which we eventually found.  We saw several kayaker navigating their crafts on the swift waterway.</span></div>",< 1 hour

After seeing the various items for sale, we took a self-tour inside the two-story house.  We admired the decor including the hard wood floors and staircase up to the second floor.  We learned that minimal changes have been made to the house since owned by Hugh Charles Leir and his family of eleven (11) children.  The dumb waiter was removed when the kitchen was modernized.  Posted information told us the history of Leir House that was built in 1927.  In 1951, it was a nurses residence before becoming a Cultural Arts Centre in 1980.  Rooms are available for rent and used for music  and dramatic arts lessons as well as meetings, workshops and other special occasions.  Leir House is the only stone-faced building in Penticton.  We exited the house and walked the grounds, visiting the Gazebo that has grape vines for a roof.  There is a small, stone building on the property that mimics the architecture of the bigger Leir House.  The gardens are lovely with several older trees growing around the house.  The lawns are meticulously groomed.</span></div>",1-2 hours

They could have been a bit better-informed -- they weren't sure about the Lasqueti Island ferry schedule, and they recommended a restaurant that is now closed -- but they were all nice. Of course they were -- they're Canadians, eh? I appreciated how they refilled my water bottle from their tap, which was helpful, because there's no drinking fountain outside. When I left, they were trying to sort out transportation to Nanaimo for two Japanese girls who somehow showed up there with no car, and speaking limited English.

We arrived there late one night as we unexpectedly ended up having to spend the night in Campbell River. It was a Thursday before the long weekend and it looked like all of the sites were booked up - the only problem with the Provincial Campgrounds is that there is no way of finding out if there's vacancies in the first come first serve sites until you arrive, and there was no sign saying No Vacancy on the road. We stopped and talked to the campground operator's and they were very friendly, found us a place to stay just for the one night and delivered fire wood right to the campsite. It's a rustic campground with a nice setting right on the lake and really nice sites with lots of trees. I would suggest making a reservation online before going, or arriving early in the day to check for vacancies.</span></div>",

As long as the A/C works it is comfortable, when it didnt it was like a boiler-house.  The first production I saw there was ""Mary Poppins"" and it was very well done with good performances from both children and adults. The second one was ""Agnes of God"", a difficult and series play, also very well done, by another theatre group using this theatre.<br><br>The third broke the pattern, unfortunately. It was   amateur performances by a group of children and adults who had had, I believe, only six days of rehearsal (it was a 'summer camp' kind of experience)  and the $15.00 admission charge was way over the top for very uneven performances. This was a show that should have been advertised 'for family and friends' of the performers, with a donation for expenses (which must have been minimal)   The improv theatre skit was one of the worst I've ever seen and should only have been performed in someone's living room for a laugh!<br><br>The administration  for T in the C lives a lot to  be desired.  My tickets, printed on the computer, stated 2 p.m. as the start, whereas others had 2.30, which is when it actually started.  As there was nothing else to do there  'in the country', not even coffee and snacks, it was annoying to have come a long way and then have to wait in the heat for the performance.</span></div>",

This is one of those attractions/landmarks I’ve passed by countless times but never really took the time to fully appreciate it or its significance. Like many things we Canadians do, this marker is fairly understated – far from being grandiose – but it denotes a highly important moment in the country’s history: The start (or termination) of the Trans-Canada Highway. Most other places would probably have flashy lights or gaudy monuments to signify such a feat, but not here. A simple sign and weathered plaque will do. After all, the marker just signifies the start (or finish) of some 8,000 kilometers of highway – the longest continuous stretch in the world!<br><br>Of course, if we’re being a bit imaginative, we can also say that “Mile Zero” has another, more philosophical and substantive, meaning. It signifies the hope embodied by Terry Fox’s “Marathon of Hope” (1980), on the one hand, and denotes the terminus, on the other hand, of Stephen Fonyo’s epic “Journey For Lives” marathon and (1984-85). The “hope” of Fox was to run across Canada, in an effort to raise funds for cancer research, and conclude his marathon at Victoria’s “Mile Zero”; however, his cancer returned and forced him to abandon his efforts at Thunder Bay. Four years later, Mr. Fonyo, who’d also lost a leg to cancer, picked up the ram’s horn and ran with it clear across the country – from St. John’s, Newfoundland to Victoria, BC – and finished his own saga at the Mile Zero marker. There is a statue of Fox and a monument to Fonyo, rightly so, adjacent to the Trans-Canada Highway “Mile Zero” marker.<br><br>From a historical perspective, then, this modest marker is deeply important not just for the sheer efforts of those involved in creating the Trans-Canada highway but also because of what it speaks to in terms of our individual and communal perseverance as a nation. And while I wouldn’t necessarily suggest making it a point to visit this landmark on its own, it nevertheless complements any journey to Beacon Hill Park.</span></div>",< 1 hour

At first I asked about renting the space and I got a few very stilted and poorly-written responses that didn't address my questions (I asked about renting in spring but was only given information about renting in summer, I asked about rates and was told to refer to a rental policy that was not attached to the email or available on the website). Finally someone else entirely sent me a ""rental policy"" that, when I was able to decipher it gave me the information I needed (very poorly written, but I was told that the organization has high school students who do summer work for them, so I guess it was written by one of them, but you would think for something like this someone would proofread it - e.g. a non-refundable deposit is required, but it is actually refundable, a lot of gibberish about photography fees, redundancy everywhere). I don't know if I am able to write fees on this website, but the rates for renting the building are double - and in some cases triple - the rates for renting any other building I have looked at in Grand Forks. The reason I am writing this on trip advisor is because I think it is really wrong for a city funded organization to be able to charge people so much for renting their space. I pay taxes to support the art gallery and I don't think that means I should be able to rent it for pennies, but I cannot believe the rates that they are charging because tax money already funds them and then now they want rental rates charged to tax payers to also fund them, and the stipulations they put on it, saying that if the event is outside of business hours on top of the space rental you have to pay $45 an hour for a staff member just to be there, plus $45 an hour for someone to set up and take down the event? I don't know anyone in Grand Forks who makes $45 an hour, though I guess I would now like to see the salaries at the art gallery. Other stipulations are that the art gallery needs to see the menu from the caterers before the event and that only members can rent the building. It seems very fascist. Finally, the rental policy had ""confidential"" stamped across it, though when I asked specifically about the confidentiality I was told that it wasn't in fact confidential...why would it be confidential if it is a rental policy for a public space? In any case, I think that the rates are way too high and I will be contacting the city about it, as well as letting my friends know. I know a lot of people who have had xmas parties and weddings at the art gallery but there is no way they paid this amount of money. Are there secret special rates that you can get if you know someone there?</span></div>",< 1 hour

I have not seen a Ranger in weeks in months patrolling these woods . The employee of GVRD on the other line just didn’t seem to care and told me someone else will get back to me and discuss this matter with me I have a complaint before many times nothing has been done the employee of GVRD on the other line after a few minutes just simply hung up on me and did not continue the discussion with me I’m fed up it’s a mismanaged organization GVRD and I will follow up with the superior For the safety of other people.

This is one of them and should not be missed!<br><br>While we missed any signs pointing towards the site, the interpretive signs along the short walk (1 km return) up the Gitwangak Battle Hill were very informative. There are a number of stairs to get up the small hill. For us a welcome opportunity to stretch our legs after a long drive. A nice 20 minute break.<br><br>You don't need to be physically fit to do those stairs, but they are not the best for visitors with mobility impairments. However, even the first few interpretive signs will give you already lots of information if you can't go all the way.<br><br>Do mark your maps/GPS for this site and don't rely on signage along the highway to find your way.</span></div>",

Lovely hike in the wintertime as trail is rather shadeless so can be rather hot in the summertime.  Lovely views of the Fraser river. Due to the proximity to the Fraser river, this area is prone to flooding as such, a dyck (doubles up as the Matsqui Trail) has been built as a flood control. A few bald eagles sighted.  Frazil ice seen moving seaward. <br><br>For the westward portion of the Matsqui Trail from the Mission Bridge parking lot, the trail is on First Nation reserve lands. For a small section of the trail we had to endure the smell from the Biowaste plant but for the rest of the trail after this point, which is called Olund trail was rather pleasant, along busy railway tracks... with at least 3 eastbound trains passed us by, and one westbound. Not as flat as the page road trail, but nothing significant, with small elevation gain of about 90m. It offers some shade in the hilly bits.<br><br>The setting sun lit up the snow-capped mountain ranges, e.g. mount baker, and on the north side, the mission bridge glowed in the setting sun.<br><br>Note that the gate to the parking lot under mission bridge closes at 6pm, so make sure you allow sufficient time to be back. Or park on street outside gated parking lots. Alternatively, there is parking at Douglas Taylor park or page road which are not gated.</span></div>",

Had this gentleman joined his friends at our lodge that week, he may have felt differently. There are inherent weather risks in every outdoor activity based holiday. If a booked beach holiday was cold and rainy, it would likewise be unreasonable to expect a refund or rain check from your hotel or tour company. The 2014/15 winter has been an anomaly and has affected the entire western half of North America. Quite simply, we cannot control Mother Nature. The skiing that week was not the deep Kootenay powder that everyone hopes for; however, we had two snowcats on the mountain every day for our guests. And for those who chose not to ski, our staff went above and beyond to provide an incredible mountain experience. In fact, our guests were so impressed by our efforts and creativity on the mountain, that they all rebooked the same week next year.</div>",

This is a therapeutic community and there is a host of programs available for people with disabilities, which include farm therapy, cooking, woodworking, to name a few. There is also the Therapeutic Riding Association which is on the grounds at Providence. St. Ann'e Garden Club has a beautiful building and plots for gardening for those who are elderly or with disabilites. There is also a community garden for the general public. Providence is situated in the Cowichan Valley and it is so worth the visit. There is a farm store for the public where people can visit to obtain some of the farm's produce. What I love are their eggs which have to be the best eggs I've tasted owing to the fact that the chickens run free and are fed organic seed. There is so much going on at Providence that it is really worth a visit. Just walking around the grounds is therapeutic in itself! Love this place.</span></div>",

The family running the farm is wonderful, and happy to teach you all about the animals they've got running around (ask about the guinea fowl, they're pretty cool with a specific purpose).  <br><br>If you're lucky enough to stay in the tiny home they have, you'll be thoroughly impressed with the amenities inside, and more so with the expansive view of the blueberry farm from your front windows.  <br><br>And finally, if it's garlic season... eat as much as you can.

Flat Lake Provincial Park,4.0,Parks,9,#8 of 11 things to do in 100 Mile House,,"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">We attempted to find this park to assess possibility of doing a multi-day canoe trip. However, we were not able to make it in. The park is not signed along the highway and we were following Google Maps / internet descriptions from the past.  It is not possible to access Davis Lake via the Davis Lake road, because the lakeshore appears privately owned - the road is gated (locked) before you reach the lake. We attempted to follow the small BCParks signs which appear right before you reach the gate, meandering 4km along an ever-shrinking rutted road (unsuitable for campers or trailers, no room to pass if you meet anyone, and limited places to turn around), only to be eventually blocked by fallen trees and large puddles.

Granted, it’s a very GOOD butcher shop with an amazing selection and helpful employees, but it’s still just, well, a butcher shop! That point out of the way, let me comment on Glenwood Meats a bit further.<br><br>As others have pointed out, this place is home to “Superior [meat and poultry] Products” and the prices are indeed very good – especially for the quality you get. My partner and I have been here a number of times over the last few years and we’ve never been disappointed with our purchases. The wieners have been of good quality; the chicken wings are phenomenal, with a few nice flavours to choose from; the house-made pepperoni sticks are delicious; and the assorted fruit pies are to die for! All of the meats are attractively laid out and clearly displayed, making the selection process a little easier (so many meats, so little time!). Glenwood is just an all-around good place . . . for meat!<br><br>One word of warning, though: This place is always very busy, so it can get a bit hectic at times but, really, that’s to be expected because Glenwood produces quality products. If they produced mediocrity then it would empty all the time and that’s far worse than being busy!</span></div>",< 1 hour

Skeena Cat Skiing Inc.,5.0,Ski & Snowboard Areas,6,#3 of 7 things to do in New Hazelton,background-image:url(https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/14/f2/69/91/home-is-where-you-park.jpg),"<div class=""WlYyy diXIH dDKKM""><span class=""NejBf"">My wife and I skied here for 4 days. For background, we've cat skied at one other location in BC too, and ski about 25 days/year, mostly in Vermont. We had a great time here! People need to understand that you generally pretty ski tame slopes in terms of pitch when cat skiing. The steeper terrain is too avalanche prone (this is true of most cat ski operations) so you ski slopes with a 30 degree or so pitch. An advanced intermediate can handle the skiing although my wife and I are both experts. Unless you nail your timing perfectly with spring temperatures and snow stability, you won't be skiing 50 degree lines like you see in ski movies. If steep skiing is your thing, you're better off waiting until late spring or going to a formal ski area where they can control avalanche risks daily. We flew into Terrrace airport, which has many more daily flights than recommended Smithers. Depending on exact dates, the staff may be able to pick you up in Terrace but you need to confirm with them prior to booking. After landing at Terrace airport, we had a two hour drive to New Hazelton, followed by a 40 minute car ride, followed by a 30 minute cat ride to base camp. They have a nice main tent with heat, couches, wifi and great food served by a very competent chef. Food was superb. You eat dinner and breakfast in the main tent, and eat lunch (sandwiches, homemade cookies, fruit) on the cat. Each sleeping tent has two twin beds, and heaters. There is a separate bathroom facility and washing facility, with hot water for showers. This means that you need to walk out from your sleeping tent to the bathroom tent to use the bathroom, even at night just to go pee.   We generally skied about 15-20 short (less than 1000 feet vertical) runs per day on a mix of alpine and gladed terrain. We had a full cat with several unrelated groups, but everyone had at least an advanced intermediate ability so we never had to wait. The location has more than one snowcat, so the backup cat (normally used for road building) can be used as primary cat if primary breaks down. While this wasn't an issue during our trip, it's extremely valuable to know that your skiing won't be limited because the sole snowcat is broken down and awaiting a spare part that needs to be sent from a parts supplier in a big city. This can happen at other cat ski operations. For us, the group dynamics were odd, but that may be particular to our group. The lead guide had only been guiding this particular location for a few weeks, and lacked the experience of skiing the complete terrain over multiple seasons, which encompasses several thousand acres here. We had several runs which were difficult wind slab that were tough skiing. You don't learn all the terrain nooks and crannies in a few weeks. The tail guide Carla was superb. She was warm, personable, competent, eager to help guests and has skied the terrain over her several years guiding at Skeena. She's a great asset to the organization. We had two minor avalanches during our stay- the first one was caused by a repeat guest who skied beyond the guide's designated boundary (the guides will give you landmarks for how far left and right of their tracks you should go). This person knowingly went slightly outside the guide's direction and caused a small avalanche on themselves. The second avalanche was on a relatively tame (maybe 35 degree)  but unskied slope when several people congregated in the same place. The weight of several people in the same spot on the slope crown caused a minor avalanche below them. Nobody was injured in either slide, but several people were very spooked by witnessing the avalanches, and this unease threw the group dynamics off even further than they were before. The group dynamics on our trip were very strained. Guides were justifiably furious with the person who knowingly skied outside of boundary, and there was a lot of arguing. There seemed to be personality clashes too between the tail and lead guide.It's a small group (12 skiers+ 2 guides) so these fights flow through to the entire group. In summary, we had a great experience of skiing powder for 4 days in a very remote area that few people will ever get to see. I will treasure this unique experience for the rest of my life. Seeing the stars at night, the clouds whip over remote peaks, the adventure of the unknown, sharing the passion for skiing and life, good food, and lots of laughs made for a great vacation. If you're the type of person who treasures a unique wilderness active ski vacation, there's nowhere better that I've found. Unlike heli skiing, you won't get grounded due to weather. A special shoutout to Lynn, who helped with the logistics and billing.  Without her, we couldn't have made it happen!</span></div>",More than 3 hours

Daughter and I dropped into the gallery on two separate occasions during this recent 2-night stay, and sure enjoyed each time spent there.<br><br>The gallery and gift shop (operated by volunteers from the Hope &amp; District Arts Council), though looking quite small in size, features a rather wide array of arts and crafts from local artists — paintings, drawings, potteries, sculptures, and the like.  <br><br>Once again, we found the gallery an interesting, and cool little place.  And service from the attending ‘host’ at the time of each visit, to be friendly, helpful, and most-informative to our many questions/queries concerning the ’what’ and ‘who’ of offerings garnering our attentions.  And this was especially so during these most-recent visits, when we had the ample time to explore everything more closely.<br><br>A must stop in Hope for us, and I would say for anyone interested in seeing some offerings from artists local to the area.</span></div>",

There are 30 or 40 islands large enough to have an anchorage, and two hundred or more coves and bays on the mainland. 300 or more anchorages, so even if there are 300 boats in the area at one time, you’ll always have a good anchorage. Lots of things to see, places to go ashore and explore  including Interesting Indian villages.  BUT a lot of the channels are pretty narrow, and sailing would be dicey or impossible. And you have to get through some tricky channels and rapids to get there and out again. We have about $10,000 worth of electronics on the boat, so figuring out the timing wasn’t too bad, but without that it would be tough – there’s no rhyme or reason to what happens when, and you have to use information from other tide and current stations and add and subtract allowances. <br>I can also understand why people don’t go any further than Desolation Sound.  The warmest water north of Santa Barbara can be found there, and great sailing – some nice open pieces of water, where there are good winds. It’s two days closer than the Broughtons (one day going, one coming back), and if your time is at all limited it would be a tough decision. And if you were in the Broughtons  and wanted to get back on a certain day, and the wind was honking, and the tides were bad, you might have to lay over for a day on two, which might make life difficult.<br>BUT Desolation has far fewer anchorages, and you’re likely to find lots of boats in any given bay or cove, so if you get in after, say, 6 PM you might not find a place to anchor, although you can almost always find a place to stern tie, in which case you don’t need much room.</span></div>",

Awestruck by the biodiversity. Yellow-headed blackbirds,red-winged blackbirds, herons, bald eagles, Canada geese and babies, swallows swooping and eating mosquitoes... Great foresight by Salmon Arm residents to have this park available for the public. I think in a Nature Park that showcases such incredible range of bird species and waterfowl, that dogs should be kept on leash - too many dogs running around and down by the flats where the birds are nesting. I was walking my dog on leash and was accosted by regulars who use this park as an off-leash run for their dogs. Kind of irresponsible I think. Anyway watch where you step as well as not all dog-owners are picking up after their free-spirited pooches.</span></div>",

We had planned to do the 10k totem to totem run but ended up doing the 'walk to breakfast' event instead and met more locals who also showed us more places of interest.

Any negative reviews I've read, I simply cannot relate to. The owners and managers of this place clearly care about it, and it shows. The place is rustic...that's why you go. It also has all of the amenities you need - clean bathrooms with showers, a gorgeous new lodge where your three hot meals are served, and cozy cabins of various sizes. The horses are visibly cared for and in great condition, and there are many of them. We had 8 in our group including one rider with no experience, to myself with a lot. The selectons/matching of horses was spot on. And to be able to ride unsupervised through this breathtaking landscape is second to none.  Green Lake is within throwing distance, and they have canoes and kayaks ready to take out if you so choose. The ONLY downside is no fishing gear available, but now that I know - I'll just bring some next time. The food is great - all served promptly and warm...and tasty! The staff in all aspects (from kitchen to serving, to ranch hands) are amazing. If only it wasn't a 5 hour drive from Vancouver, I'd be there with regularity. We were there during a slower weekend, I think...but I can imagine this place would be hopping all summer long. It deserves to be!</span></div>",

You’ll come to an access road which takes you down to a very well maintained parking area right on the lake. <br><br>It’s amazing to think that the Columbia river flows from here, down into Oregon and the Pacific. <br><br>It was bitterly bitterly cold on our visit. The wind picking up the cold from snow covered slopes the length of the lake, and the deep deep ice covering the entire, vast expanse of water. <br><br>Fingers were excruciatingly sore after seconds of being exposed. The cold but through clothing immediately. If you come here mid winter, wrap up!<br><br>Bring a camera. You won’t regret it. </span></div>",

The trails are wide and the scenery is beautiful. Grab some water and lunch in a back pack &amp; don't forget bug spray &amp; your camera with lots of memory and an extra battery!  If you start your hike at Rubble Creek/Black Tusk parking lot. You will walk through the forest for 6.5 km to a junction. I would suggest to go left to Taylor Meadows where streams, mountain tops and beautiful flowers are everywhere. Keep walking towards Garibaldi Lake. You will take switchbacks down and soon a green blue take will peak through the trees. So beautiful you will think t is fake. Go down the hill, across a bridge and around the lake. Keep following the trail to the ranger station where your camera will add up to hundreds of beautiful pictures. Stop at one of the picnic tables and have some lunch. The Whiskey Jacks will swoop down and eat from your hands, if you invite them. When you are done head back around the lake, up the hill and go left. Soon you will come to Lesser Lake with more picture ops and perhaps a dip in the lake. When you are done keep going. You will come to a view point, go left down a trail that you think is going no where. Soon a rocky outcrop with little Chipmunks appear at your feet. It is stunning! Valley views as far as your eyes can see. Another spot for a snack and your new friends will eat from the palm of your hand. When you are done keep going and you will come to the junction you were at earlier in the day. Follow the switchbacks down. It will seem like forever. You will come to a bridge...splash some mountain water on you and carry on. Soon you will hear the raging river from the parking lot and shortly after the first glimpse of cars in the parking lot. You did it! 22 Km's of pure heaven. Head to Whistler's Village for a yummy reward of your choice! My choice a nice cold Whistler award winning beer...<br>Lori aka Hiking for the Scaredy Cat</span></div>",

The trail is built and maintained by first nation people who live on the island, and what a fabulous job they do.  As you are walking on a wooden boardwalk it is impossible to damage the flora and fauna, it feels surreal wandering through this ancient woodland and out to the saltflats.  Huge thanks to the people of the island for allowing us to share this forest.</span></div>",2-3 hours

Along with the beachfront, nearby public pools and trendy street-beats have driven up the homeowners prices, making it a haven for stylish home goods stores, from design and furniture, to supplies and appliances.

Me being the new wine drinker that I am decided to go visit some wineries for some testing.<br> My husband has never liked wine. <br> Anyways.... my mother in law points out a few, the first being a wine and cheese tasting place. We stop in there and were not even greeted. Another busy and couldnt care less that we were there. <br>Funny thing is I was on a holiday and I was willing to spend but nowhere we stopped gave us the time of day.<br> So we were on our way home and I saw Monster Vinyeards. The parking lot was empty but I'm thinking this place looks super good and appealing. I say let's stop there! It must be closed they said.<br> So we go in and there was a very cool and friendly blonde lady who makes us feel so welcome! We get FREE wine testing! Ok now I'm happy because not only were we treated as equals but the wine was AMAZING and get this my husband even loved the red wine. We bought a couple of bottles! A couple days later we thought we would try the wine tasting thing again and I was so disappointed...same story, for one we were not treated like we mattered and we did not like the wine, of course we bought a few bottles...well just because. So again we stopped in at Monster and there was a nice younge girl who was cool and gave us some FREE tastings. Loved it!!! Red eye is our favourite wine now!

The area considered the rubbing beach is covered in uniformly sized, smooth and rounded rocks. The surf sweeps them in and out and they make a clacking sound as they tumble against each other.

My husband and I visited lots of different places before selecting this one and nothing else even came close. We got amazing pictures and lots of our guests complimented our unique choice. The venue itself deserves 5 stars. However, this review is about the service provider who we had a lot of difficulty with after the wedding (and potentially before if our wedding planner hadn’t taken over communication on our behalf).<br><br>Our wedding was held on October 13 with less than 100 guests. We signed the contract before the wedding and put down the full amount, as well as credit card information for the damage deposit (this was all in the contract which we received from Jill, signed and then sent back to her). There were some extra rental items which we knew we would use but we would decide the exact number on the day of based on the weather and our needs. <br><br>The day after our wedding, Jill sent my MIL (who had offered to cover the cost of extra rentals) an invoice for $3,166. In her email, she told my MIL that it was very generous of her to cover “the outstanding invoice and last-minute rentals”. Just to clarify, there was no outstanding amount left for the venue rental fee (we paid it in full BEFORE the wedding) and the “last minute rentals” were all items we’d discussed 2 weeks before the event.<br><br>I reviewed the invoice, got some clarification from our wedding planner and emailed Jill with some questions. Just to be clear, I never said to Jill that we didn’t want to pay (on the contrary, she’d already charged my MIL’s card without giving us a chance to review the invoice so not paying was out of the question). We simply wanted clarification on the items listed in the invoice. I won’t go through the whole thing but there a few items I’d like people to be aware of.<br>-	Heaters– our contract clearly stated that heaters were $110 each but the invoice didn’t even say how many we used – there was simply a lumpsum amount charged for the heaters. According to our planner, we used 7 so I asked Jill why we were being charged for 8 and never got an answer.<br>-	Tent set up and take down for our caterer – Jill’s husband, John, offered to set up a tent for the caterer. The caterer didn’t know there was a charge for it and it wasn’t approved by me, my husband or our wedding planner. In fact, our caterer had brought his own tent and would’ve put it up if he (or we!) had been told we would be charged for using theirs. <br>-	Firewood – this wasn’t in the contract, nor was it ever verbally expressed to us but we were still charged for it. <br>-	Labor per hour for her husband and his assistant – our contract stated that their assistance would be $50/hour as an extra item and nowhere was it stated that it was required. We NEVER put in an official request. John was there at the wedding and offered to help without making it clear that we would be charged. We ended up paying $300 (for 6 hours of labor) for help that we never requested and that was after she reduced it from 9 hours (so basically she billed us for the whole event). If onsite assistance is mandatory for the whole event, that should be clearly stated in the contract.<br><br>I was expecting a reply from Jill with an explanation for the charges but unfortunately, all we got was a long emotional diatribe about how happy everyone was, how many last minute requests they accommodated and how we left decisions until the day of which caused unnecessary panic (still don’t know who was panicking and why since we’d discussed everything ahead of time). None of the above items were addressed in her email except for one. <br><br>Not only that, there were accusations in the email against us which were blatant lies (we have documentation to prove everything). <br>-	Apparently, once our wedding planner made initial contact, Jill only heard from her once until the day of the wedding. This is false and we have the emails to prove it. Our planner was in constant communication with them, both via email and over the phone.<br>-	Jill claimed not to know that our caterer would arrive the evening before to set up but our planner discussed this at length on the phone with John. Maybe there was some miscommunication between them (?) but that wasn’t our fault.<br>-	Jill was unable to take a damage deposit as she apparently didn’t have a credit card on file. That’s not true since the contract had a specific section that clearly stated the credit card information being provided was for a damage deposit (which we completed and sent back to her). If she didn’t this information, why didn’t she simply tell us?<br>-	We were accused of not sending her a list of rentals 7 days before the wedding. However, our wedding planner sent us a copy of the email she sent Jill 14 days before the wedding which clearly stated which rentals we required.<br>-	Jill expressed unhappiness that I didn’t communicate with her after holding my makeup trial at the venue (which Jill was kind enough to let us do) but that’s the purpose of a wedding planner; once she took over, she handled communication with ALL the vendors. I wasn’t purposely ignoring Jill and if she expects the bride to be in touch with her, that should be stated in the contract. <br>-	Jill stated that a bear broke into the food truck left on site by the caterer. When I asked our caterer, he said that didn’t happen. A bear DIDN’T break into the truck; he did drag some empty containers away from the truck down near the river but at no point was the food truck broken into!<br><br>I found Jill’s communication to be extremely unprofessional and condescending at times. When we did the initial site visit, we weren’t informed that are no guest bathrooms on site. When I expressed my unhappiness at not being told this important piece of information, her husband kindly offered to pay $300 towards the cost of a rental unit but in Jill’s email, she said “I felt bad I had not specified that necessity, and as a gesture of goodwill and help you with your limited resources, offered 50% credit toward the $300 quote for Carney's economical rental units.  I guess your budget must have increased  as you ordered a $1500 Sunshine unit.  We still applied $300 toward this high end rental and did not apply like other venues, any charges for early drop off and late pick up.” WE DIDN’T ASK FOR CHARITY! Whether our resources were limited or unlimited was none of her business. What we eventually decided to rent and pay for was none of her business. Her comment about our budget/resources was completely unprofessional and unnecessary.<br><br>Also, part of the labor charges were for wiping down the tables and chairs that were to be provided as part of our contract. What kind of venue charges for cleaning their own tables and chairs?! It’s a very reasonable expectation that they would be set up for us without us incurring any extra charges.<br><br>After several emails back and forth where we were reminded that the only reason the wedding was a success is because of the extras Jill provided and all the running around she did, the final straw was when she called my MIL and told her she no longer wanted to communicate with me and my husband. We, the clients, who signed the contract and paid $6,000 to use the venue are no longer welcome to contact her and try to get clarification on the items my MIL paid for. <br><br>In addition to all of this, please be aware that we often felt like Jill’s main objective was to promote her business.<br>-	She asked my MIL if we would put HER business’s logo on OUR wedding favors – what kind of vendor asks a couple to put their logo on wedding favors?! We’re not there to provide free advertising!<br>-	Jill also pushed us to write a review before the wedding. Again, who expects a review before goods/services are actually provided?!<br>-	After all this mess, she still had the audacity to tell us she would be majorly disappointed if we’re not willing to share our pictures with her. She even asked our videographer for pictures! Just because we used her venue for our wedding, doesn’t mean she owns the wedding now…we’re not obliged to provide her with any pictures or videos nor was it stated in the contract. She shouldn’t be reaching out to our other vendors to acquire goods that she has no right to. <br><br>In a nutshell, the venue is gorgeous. There are tons of great spots for pictures and you’ll get a great rustic farm atmosphere with a lot of natural beauty. John is very easy-going, helpful and a pleasure to work with. <br><br>However, beware before signing a contract that communication with Jill will tough. It will be difficult to get a straight answer if you question anything and you’ll feel as if your wedding is owned by the venue. <br><br>We had to deal with false accusations and blatant lies. All our other vendors were amazing and a pleasure to work with. However, we spent our honeymoon dealing with Jill and the invoice she sent my MIL all because we asked a few questions (which remain unanswered) so we ended up paying for stuff without either knowing we would be charged for it or without clarification on why we were paying the amount that we did. <br><br>If you decide to have your wedding here, please make sure you write every single thing down (although that didn’t help either since we were wrongly accused even when things were documented). Don’t let Jill push you into writing a review BEFORE your wedding and don’t feel obliged to let her take pictures. It’s YOUR wedding. YOU decide who takes pictures and YOU decide what you want to share.</span></div>",1-2 hours

People had boats on the lake, others were practicing their rock climbing skills and others had massive spreads of delicious looking picnics laid out on the tables. It's all just so easily accessed and so well done. Toilets are lovely and clean - it's all a credit to the people that are charged with maintaining this little gem. Well worth a stop!</span></div>",

There is also a walkway to the “blowhole”.  This is an easier boardwalk, as there is no climbing involved (unless you want to walk on the hardened lava).   We did not see the water come through the blowhole the day we were there, as the tide was not at the right point.   The North Beach goes on for miles.   The beach is made of up sand, and rocks.

This place is beautiful! Potholes full of water for your own private tub or a water fall to jump off of! The drive from Comox is about 15 mins. Lots of places to park. Easy to get down to the waters edge via a path. There are a few walking trails along the side of the river but I don't know how good they are because we didn't go on them. Once you are to the waters edge you have to be really careful walking on the rocks because there are lots of potholes. Some are very big and some very small and some just perfect for your foot to go in and that would hurt if you didn't know it was there. You can sit in some of the large potholes or sit in the slow moving rapids. Great spot for a picnic! If you walk down further you will see the water falls. They are not huge but big enough that you can jump off them if your brave enough! In spots the water is very deep and other spots it'd good for wading! We love this place and have been back a few times! We usually stay for 3-4 hours but it's up to you if you want a quick dip to cool off or sit around all day and hang out with friends! Stotan falls does not have food, so bring a picnic and does not have washrooms but Im sure you can figure out where to go! LOL</span></div>",2-3 hours

Some of the signs indicated it was a 40 minute hike, but we felt it was more like only 20 minutes or so. The hike was short and it is an interesting spot with red clay mud and some old indigenous history. However, be advised that it is a muddy trail. Some spots were fortified with platforms made of wood and other items to help you along the way. There are two (and a half) paint pots: a large one, medium and a small one in the trail. Do not make the mistake and walk up further into the forested area with wood platforms; there are no more ""pots"" there, and you don't see nice views until a few kilometers in.<br><br>Please indicate if you found this review to be helpful as it will better focus my future review efforts, thanks!</span></div>",

Some sites overlook the lake but close to highway sounds.<br><br>I would give this campground a 4/5 but our generator was stolen from our campsite. It was securely locked to the trailer -- not a crime of convenience but planned. There is no gate to monitor traffic. Do not valuables out even if locked up.</span></div>",

Based around a  memorial to the crew of HMCS ALBERNI, a corvette from the Second World War, the displays expand out to include other aspects of the RCN, the Great War, and the other branches of the military.  One gets a good feeling for life during those periods of conflict, and relationships that were forged and lives forever changed.  This is a museum that tells many stories.

It's pretty small, so you don't need a lot of time here unless you get to talking to the owner, who was really nice. I was driving so I didn't have any of the wine here, but my boyfriend bought a couple bottles of red wine. The interior actually seems to be the front of the winery itself, so you can see all the barrels and stuff behind the barfront, it's pretty cool. It's a little different from other places we've visted, where it's like a little restaurant/gift shop kinda thing (though they do sell some merch like shirts and stuff), this is more of a straight up, no-nonsense ""look here, we're a winery"" kind of place. I liked the interior a lot. It's very easy to find, there's a big spider on the building and it's literally right next to the road. Definitely worth a stop.</span></div>",< 1 hour

The lake is very rural and has A few well hidden homes/cabins around it. Lots of underwater obstacles (fallen trees) so watch your fins! I spent approximately one hour there, and enjoyed how quiet it was! <br>Well I was paddling back towards the boat launch I saw a bridge that was connecting the boat launch area to the main recreational area, so I decided once I packed my stuff in the car I would check it out. Very beautiful have a wooded area. When I turned around to head back to my car I saw something giant scoot across my foot! I’ve bent over to take a closer look thinking it was a giant spider because the name of the lake is spider Lake. However I was pleasantly surprised it was a baby frog!

The upper sites along the highway are great if you don't mind being woken up by a semi screaming down the highway every two minutes all night long. Seriously - I  woke up in terror a couple of times because it sounded like an out of control truck was going to rip through our campsite. Plus, the upper sites have no privacy because there are hardly any trees. Be prepared to roast in the sun. As well, there is no running water in the campground. There is only one place to get water and that is a hand pump station. Be prepared to work for your water and depending on what vessel you are filling, it could be a two person job. There are only outhouses and they are not lit so bring a flashlight if you need to use one at night. There isn't even hand sanitizer to clean your hands with. In August the river is very low. I felt sorry for people who brought floaties along thinking they were going to drift down the river. Even a little dip in the river in place of a shower is pretty much impossible to do.<br><br>The landscape is nice and if not for the noise it wouldn't be a terrible place to camp. However, if you expect peace and quiet and the sounds of nature, you aren't going to get it here.</span></div>",

I live here and try to walk around this wilderness lake once per week because it is such beautiful, exciting wilderness, but so handy to civilization, only a 15-minute drive away from home.</span></div>",2-3 hours

Unfortunately there are just too many adjustments that need to be made.<br><br>Firstly...right on hwy 4 where it is impossible to get away from road noise. Staff are lovely if you can find them.  Most of the time there is no one at the front desk.  Even in an emergency you wouldn't be able to contact someone in the know because no one is ever around.  It is the little things that make you realize the price per room is outrageous.   Garbage cans outside were overflowing and not a soul to empty them.  Chairs on outside balconies are dirty and surrounded by cobwebs.  They are even found in surrounding trees. No one seems to care about outside of property.  The pond in back needs cleaning.....the mold surrounding caused me to have an asthma attack.  Rooms lack things like lightbulbs in lamps, bath mats plus  proper pillows not made of plastic.  The beds are wonderful however.  Going across the street to pick up a breakfast sandwich leaves something to be desired.   This resort has a kitchen so why not serve a continental breakfast to your guests.  Outdoor dining area is very nice but the chef needs to learn how to not overcook ling cod and chicken.  $18  for an appetizer salad is a bit much .  Staff are young and quite inexperienced on how to set a table.  We had to ask for water glasses, cutlery and napkins.  Presentation of food needs improvement.  The staff seem to try their best but an experienced manager is needed to run this place.  Too many standing around not knowing what to do.  We expected something special and did not get it.  Outside doors lock you out even with a proper room key.  No one seems to notice or care about the details that make a resort worth going back to.</span></div>",

All the skis and pictures on the walls made me start craving the moment the snow starts falling again. I hope to come back in the winter. We used the lodge as basecamp and headed out for an adventure that turned into a much larger event than we had anticipated. Our kid sized adventure turned epic when Sean spotted a grizzly charging at him. Leaving all our food behind, we started running, our four year old on our backs, for another 9 km's off trail. Luckily we reached Reg and Cathy by SAT phone and they picked us up at another trailhead after a tired and hungry epic. We are not in the belly of a bear and  in the end we got a lovely alpine traverse in past glacial tarns, alpine meadows, goat beds, and even a quick dip in Opal Lake. Reg and Cathy showed what it takes in the backcountry to help each other out. They put aside their roof repairs and water resupply to help us feel safe and rescue us with food and ATVs.

We ended up hiking through some rougher trails - nothing that anyone in reasonable shape can't manage - through the forest and over bridges.  Our only concern is that there is no real indication of where to turn and what to follow once you leave the wheelchair accessible portion of the trail.  I think we ended up hiking a lot further on the rougher portion than the Regional District map indicated that we would, so we may have been off-track without knowing it.

You get to the end of the suspension bridges and either have to go all the way back across all of the suspension bridges or take a dirt path back to the parking lot. The koi pond was absolutely disgusting and sludgy, there were no fish to be seen, the vineyards were in poor shape and I have to wonder at how successful this gentleman will be at growing grapes. The ""magnificent"" waterfall that is a selling feature was not working. There were loose boards and cracked boards along the boardwalk.  There were was lots of seating at the main facility and after one of the suspension bridges but no restaurant! It seems like a waste of money as nothing seems to be going on at the moment.

It is chilling to think of 2000 Nisga'a souls buried beneath the lava - with only a handful of survivors. The waterfalls and pools were beautiful and the suspension bridge in Canyon City not for the faint (or weak) hearted!!<br>The second day I did the volcano cone hike with Nisga'a guide Steve. His great grandmother was one of the few survivors and he talked with passion and knowledge about the eruption. He also pointed out wildlife on the 4 hour trip. You have to book this tour at the visitor centre.<br>The best point was the amazing scenery and we saw lots of black bears of all shapes and sizes from the safety of the car.<br>The down side is the lack of places to eat and not much available in the only store we found in New Aiansh. Pack a picnic is my best tip.</span></div>",

The landscape gets a bit rougher but the path is good and you come upon crater lake between 1-2 hours. A short descent takes you to the lake shore.  <br><br>We continued our climb up the left hand side of the lake and followed the crater rim round.

With the early June visit, we anticipated the falls would be great due to the spring snow melt, which was correct.  It would have been nice to separate the falls review from the Eco Park review.<br><br>You will need to park on the north side of the road at the Eco Park area.  As the falls walk is on south side of the highway, you need to cross the street.  There is no crosswalk right there on the highway, so it may be best to walk to the corner of the block to the east, then cross.  We ended up crossing right at the parking lot, which on the day we went, the highway was not that busy.<br><br>The Eco Park itself may have been a nice place before, but it appears overgrown and not kept up.  Lots and lots of weeds including in the parking area as to make it that we were not sure if we could park where we did.  I think the municipality should be taking better care of this park as it could be a nice spot for a picnic, or for just enjoying the scenery.<br><br>The falls walk is very pleasant and you hardly know you are in a town.  The water was rushing down the ""creek"" which sounded nice and created a good atmosphere.  We have little ones along (4 and 6) and they had no problem with the walk.  It is quite senior friendly as well in my opinion.<br><br>The view point is decent, it just does not allow you to see the entire falls.  We walked a bit further to see the open valley (and the sewage treatment plant).<br><br>Overall a decent thing to do as it does not take much time.</span></div>",< 1 hour

In this public pool, the real hot springs water comes out only at the shallow end, where it's super hot and doesn't smell as bad of chlorine.

From the hotel where we stayed – overall drive time to the trail-head was about 50 minutes. To reach parking lot/trail-head, you will be driving on Cheakamus Road about 7 km off the highway on a very rough road – this last mile drive itself will take about 20-30 minutes depending on the car<br><br>Hike details:<br>We did this hike on Aug 01st 2019. The hiking was very enjoyable. <br>Overall – 14 km round trip on a relatively flat terrain. <br>There were two parts to the hike – in about 3 kms from the parking lot, you will get to the Cheakamus Lake – very beautiful location. We (Group of 12 members that included 6 children) spent about an hour here enjoying the views. From here, you can either return to the parking lot or go further for another 4 km to the Singing Creek Campground. We decided to walk further and visited the Singing Creek. Here you get to experience the views of the same mountains and lake from a different perspective!<br><br>Other items to note: <br>1)	There are signs showing that this place is bear country, so please be mindful. But,we did not see/encounter any bears. <br>2)	This trail is biker friendly - we came across a few bikers on this trail during our hike<br>3)	We did not carry any bug sprays and we did not have any trouble<br><br>Strongly recommended if you like/love doing family hikes</span></div>",

We went during early October, the weather was perfect for hiking and outdoor activities, with plenty of sunshine. Driving from Kamloops it took a little less than two hours. We first stopped at the Wells Gray Visitor Center which was located at the entrance of the park. At the visitor center you can get a map of the park, and the friendly staff explained to us the major attractions and how long it takes to drive from one point to another, which we found very helpful. We went to the nearest two waterfalls - the Dawson Fall and the Helmcken Fall. At the Dawson Fall, you can take a short walk (about 10 minutes) to get to the base. At that point you can get a close look of the waterfall and you can actually touch the water. The Helmcken Fall was the largest waterfall in the park and the view was absolutely splendid! There was a picnic area at the Helmcken Fall where you can enjoy your food while listening to the sound of the waterfall. It was such a wonderful experience.<br>If you only visit the Dawson Fall and the Helmcken Fall, it should take around 3-4 hours. Be sure to bring enough clothes as it gets pretty cold when you are near the waterfall.</span></div>",

If you have more time and trail conditions are suitable take the trail to Twin Falls, for which you need a full day really, this is 6.5km each way, starts off flat then rises to the falls. Amazing views and the further you go the less people you will encounter.<br>On the way you pass Laughing Falls, a single waterfall. A great outdoor experience with typically Canadian views - dense forest, clear mountain rivers, isolation. Very enjoyable. In summer there is a mountain hut near twin falls where everything is carried in by people and food is cooked on a wood-burning stove. It's only open for a short summer season, closed when we visited.</span></div>",1-2 hours

This is how a natural hot spring should be like. No cement pools or terrible old shower rooms. This is nature made accessible with nice wooden planks, wooden stairs etc. <br>To get there you walk on a nice wooden boardwalk through the beautiful forest. Once there you can change in the change rooms. <br>The pool is extremely hot in one end and you will literally burn yourself if you walk all the way up there. The further you move down the cooler the crystal clear water is. <br>The staff is constantly cleaning the wooden stairs because the heat makes the algae grow so fast. <br>On the road to the hot springs you will with almost 100% guarantee see bears and bison. We saw 12 bears and about 30 bison just on the side of the road. Amazing!<br>Only the Katherine hotsprings in Australia beats this place.</span></div>",

The hatchery has a rather unassuming little visitor center, and a nice gift shop. But the best part is a wall of glass windows along the salmon run, where you can see the salmon swimming underwater, and then leaping up to the next step. The kids I saw there would shriek with delight each time the fish jumped. There is also a gorgeous system of hiking trails through the rainforest valley in the surrounding park-- a destination in its own right.<br><br>I almost rented a car to get here, but I am glad I didn't because I think I would have gotten lost! Instead, I took the city bus that goes from Lonsdale Quay (the sea bus stop) towards Grouse mountain. I got off the bus at Cleveland dam, and hiked down through the forest to the hatchery. It was probably about a mile, but I think you could do a shorter route if you wanted to. Before you go, sure to print out the trail map at the Capilano Regional Park website. That map also shows the bus stops.</span></div>",

This place has quite possibly the best reds in the Okanagen and is always one of the true highlights of our annual trip to the area.<br><br>This last visit was a bit strange however.<br><br>We stopped by and sat outside on the patio, first for a tasting, then afterwards we ordered a bottle of rose that we greatly enjoyed.<br><br>At this point a particularly nice car pulled up and a white haired gentleman stepped out brandishing what looked to be a pair of miniature tennis rackets. I assume from the car that he was the owner, although he may have been some eccentric rich local.<br><br>He stood next to one of the other tables and began swinging the rackets wildly around his head, a slightly crazed look in his eye. He was apparently protecting the occupants of the table from insects, which I suppose is fair enough if they are being bothered by them. He then stomped his way round the patio, finishing off the wounded and kicking them to the side like the insect hooligans that they were.<br><br>It was at this point that he apparently decided that if these insects want a war, then a war they would get, and that he would take the fight to them. He strode off into the bushes with the look of a man on a mission. We were surrounded by dozens of these bushes, but there were two that particularly drew his ire. <br><br>He swung again and again, taking out any unsuspecting bee, wasp or decorative plant unwise enough to stray into his path. It was a massacre.<br><br>Eventually, he was spent. He trudged back to the patio, half blind from sweat, his shoulders slumped.<br><br>“I like to turn off the electricity on these things” he said to one table, nodding at his murder racquet. “Kills ‘em better”. “I think I got 100 of them.” he winked at another, before jauntily springing back into his particularly nice car and speeding off. What a guy!<br><br>So as I said, this is place offers amazing wine and is a fantastic place to visit. As long as you are not a bee or a wasp.</span></div>",

Every pool formed a distinct mini-aquarium with an amazing array of shellfish, corals and seaweeds clinging to their rock footholds. A wonderful array of colour and form. We tracked a pacific red octopus in one of the deeper pools to the delight of the kids. Great educational as well as relaxing afternoon, with a shore lunch. Highly recommended.</span></div>",

Thank you for taking the time to provide a detailed description about our cabins onboard between Prince Rupert and Port Hardy.

I am sorry to hear that you found it difficult to find information on what our cabins had to offer. I always recommend contacting our Customer Service Centre at 1-888-223-3779 extension 0 so that an agent can provide these details for you. That being said, you have provided some fantastic information in your description! I am happy to hear that the pillows were fluffy and the beds were comfortable. 

What a treat to have been able to see marine life during your crossing! It must have added to an already gorgeous trip.

We appreciate your 5-star review and we look forward to sailing with you again sometime soon.

Considering the wet weather during the long weekend of early July this location was secluded dry and far from the rural life. We embarked on the journey without knowing much about the location. All of us left home around 2pm and reached the destination by 3:30pm the first sight of it was almost like any other location in BC. We found a place to settle down and start our BBQ while the ladies went into the water. As men usually do we opened our cans of Canadian Beer and Jack Daniel while dealing with some fresh meat on the BBQ. As the hours crept by we enjoyed every minute of fun, jokes, frisbees, badminton and mainly the food. The place turned out to be amazingly calm and quite and we surely would go back. Alloutte Lake is getting crowded and now we have found an alternative to our favourite spot. I wish all of you who are reading this also enjoy the place. One small request from my side please keep the place clean. We even grabbed some garbage and recyclables that other visitors left behind.</span></div>",

Thank you for your review. 

You've provided a great tip for future travelers. If you plan to park and travel as a foot passenger, be sure to check parking capacity ( located under Current Conditions on our website) prior to starting your adventure. I have to say, it doesn't matter the time of week, if you're looking for an adventure, sailing has to be one of the best ways to explore British Columbia. 

Sounds like we'll see you onboard again soon.

There are helpful little orange diamonds posted along the trail to keep you oriented, but sometimes it is easy to get a little confused.  You don't need that much water for a day trip unless you are carrying a big pack.  If you aren't camping....don't carry a big pack.  I took two standard size water bottles - maybe a liter each.

Thank you for taking the time to review us. I totally understand your comment on the U.K. pricing. 
Two points to ponder ~ you find the British pricing on the labels because all of our products are genuine U.K &amp; NOT made for export. We buy the items in Britain &amp; have them shipped in. Many of the products with familiar labels that you may see in Canada have different ingredients. I.e. made for export. 
Secondly, not only are you getting REAL British products, you are saving on the airfare ! 
Hope to see you again very soon 🇬🇧</div>",

If you try and get this run done by 1130 or so, you'll get to Dusty's before it gets too busy for lunch.</span></div>",

If you want deep and step you can find it easily in this family resort. <br><br>We stayed in the fireside apartments which were comfortable and  functional.We ordered in groceries online  before we arrived so we could eat in every second night. This was a great idea, and we were pleased to arrive to find the groceries unpacked and in the cupboards and fridge.<br><br>As good as the skiing was, the highlight was the dog sledding. We love dogs so seeing them get so excited about teaming up and running the sled was a great experience, as was the process of getting them into their harnesses and back to their kennels after for frozen salmon heads for dinner.<br><br>While we are tempted to go back to sunpeaks because we had such a good time, we will probably try somewhere else next time...

Short drive from town of Nelson across the orange bridge. After you turn into Johnston Rd from Hwy 3A, drive on and come across the overload parking first on the left and the trail head parking on the right. The whole trail is signposted. It was about 10am weekday and I met probably local residents hiking down the trail. Came across a few numeric signs (4, 13 &amp;20) at acute turns along the trail. 20 supposed to be the last to reach the viewpoint. I really took my time to ascend and take pictures. The hike took me 50 min but anyone could do it in about half an hour. Ascending made me huff and puff, in a good way! Descending is easier. Due to the smoke from wildfires (Arrow Lake?), the view over the town of Nelson is hazy and obscured unfortunately. There are several benches around the viewpoint where I rested, enjoyed the view and had a light snack. It is an excellent trail. </span></div>",

There are a couple of benches along the way so you can sit for hours and enjoy the view.  <br><br>The second night we went, we tried to just catch the sunset (which was of course gorgeous in its own right) but we were also lucky enough to see the grey whales swimming right past the point.

There is a wilder but marshier area north of the ""managed"" park with a few paths, and a path that joins the  seawall/dike area outside of the park, that goes on for a few kilometers. <br>It was on this extension from the park that we saw a flock of snow geese (quite rare) landing and eating on the outer side of the dike.

It is large enough to take you a couple of hours to simply walk through it, and some of the landscaped fauna is quite breathtaking, one of the reasons it is popular as a wedding backdrop. There is also a restaurant (slightly pricey), should you choose to have a bite to eat.<br><br>At the peak of the hill is a fountain ""show""... a great place for kids to wade and enjoy waterplay. Also there is Bloedel Conservatory, but that will cost you $4.50 per person to tour. Inside the conservatory, besides the tropical plants, are exotic birds that wander around freely.

I am extremelly happy that we made this decision because it is one of the most beautiful places I have been to.  It is semi remote, but you may see a few people when you are there (depending on the season).  In order to get to the lake you have to wheel your canoe down on carts, depending how much weight you have in your canoe this can be extremely difficult but well worth it.  We went to the west end of the lake towards diamond lagoon and stayed at an island right before smoker island.  I would recommend staying on an island due to the mass amounts of bugs.  The fishing was also fantastic.  If your fishing in the lake I would suggest an earthworm on a spinner.  We caught loads of fish and had plenty of bites as well.  I would also suggest leaving early in the morning to get to your campsite.  We left at noon and were met by a lethal wind that made it extremely difficult to canoe.  Overall, a trip I will never forget and I hope to repeat soon!</span></div>",

There are only a few bridges across the river. We encountered 4 or 5 different groups who were staring at the faded maps posted along the route who were trying to figure out where they were going. We were also one of them. The trail cannot be accessed at Marie Canyon. It can at Trestle 66. <br><br>Skutz falls isn’t really anything more than a trickle over some rocks in mid August and I can’t foresee it being much more than that at any point in the year. I didn’t take a photo of it. <br><br>The loop from Trestle 66 to Skutz Falls and back on the other side of the river is a decent walk:<br><br>The “road” side has excellent river views of the blue green water and rocky canyon walls. It also has a spot to access the brackish river water at the group camping area. Group site looked really well kept with cabin-like cookhouse and lots of outside space for a great party. <br><br>The “forest” side was a good trail through skinnier trees and had decent views of the surrounding landscape and mountains. You didn’t see the river very much and it didn’t look as nice as from the other side. <br><br>We enjoyed our 8-9km dog walk on this portion of the trail. The type of trees fluctuated depending on proximity to the water and sun exposure. We saw a bear on the road about 5 km away from trestle 66, so bring bear spray. Bring water. <br><br>Don’t go expecting and amazing canyon or waterfall. Go for a forest walk along a nice river.</span></div>",

We always went in the late winter or early spring. No crowds. Be aware that on Vancouver Island at high season you will not be alone. We travelled all over Vancouver Island and The Queen Charlotte Islands. This is a great start if you want to see what remains of the wilderness in BC.

Since we were  on a sailboat, we took the ferry to Quadra Island and then walked about 1 1/2 miles to find the Centre. There are little signs directing along the highway, but no sidewalks. Luckily, traffic is light and the scenery is relaxing.  <br>The museum is compact  and has probably a hundred masks, artifacts and other First Nations items. I found the blown up historical photographs really interesting as they showed  how villages were built.  The newspapers of the day were fascinating--not only stories about First Nation issues, but other world events happening. Most of the items are in glass boxes, although the totems and a few masks are in the open. The gift shop is very small with a few local artists represented.<br>There also is a totem carving shed, but when we visited, no one was available to discuss the totems being carved.  The Centre is definitely worth a visit, though, and it should be better promoted because the First Nation history found here is educational. There also is a walk along the beach that sounded fun, but we'd already walked 1 1/2 miles and had another 1 1/2 miles to get back to the ferry.</span></div>",

Some people fish here, some come to enjoy swimming at the beach area, and others walk their dogs responsibly here. But some of us just stroll around and enjoy the sights and sounds of splendid nature at it's finest. From the parking lot, if you head off to the right, it's not long before you are on a lovely little bridge, from which you can watch a babbling brook in one direction or look out over the serene lake on the other side. If the stress of jobs and the city is wearing on you, come and let that stress flow away out over the beautiful serene lake.</span></div>",

Whether you are a walk, a jogger, or a cyclist, this is a lovely stretch of countryside with fields, farms and horses.</span></div>",

They basically built a boardwalk over the hiking trail to get down to the water views you see in the picture.<br><br>I thought the wildlife would be more interesting at the bottom but when we were there there was no one fishing or crabbing. It was still a nice scenic place to see and very picturesque, but probably did not land in my top 5 highlights of my trip to Sooke. I could see it being a great place to take young children who may be too young to hike on an actual hiking trail or as an other way to burn off some energy and pass some time.</span></div>",

The path is well maintained but it is a dirt trail so bring good runners or hiking boots. Some areas have small staircases with broken steps and there are areas near the end where you are climbing up and around some rocks and roots. Not a big deal but nice to have your hands free for extra stability.<br> <br>The trail goes through lush forest and passes a nice beach along the way and the Bluffs is a beautiful spot to take pics before you get to the end.<br><br>Just before the end of the trail is the Courage Staircase which brings you up to the rock on top of which is the view down onto the inlet where Ripple Rock was. Lots of space to sit, relax or wander around. No bathroom facilities.

From there follow the signs for Harmony Lake. The 2.5 km long trail gradually descends through alpine forests offering majestic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Along the way you can enjoy the beautiful and delicate alpine flowers, usually in bloom in August, and have a glimpse of the friendly and curious tiny chipmunks who call this place home. It takes about 40 minutes of a relaxed walk to reach the lake, including the stops for taking photos. <br>Once there, you can walk on the broad-walk around the lake and then go back the same way you came in. However, I highly recommend you to take the Harmony Meadows Trail on your way back. This means that from the lake level you will start ascending, going around the lake, and will be viewing the lake from above. The views are just awesome and the trail itself is very scenic. That way you will make a loop and will enjoy the lake and the alpine landscape from different perspectives. <br>For you to consider is that there a lots of mosquitoes and flies at the lake in the summer, nevertheless this hike is entirely worth doing.<br>Please wear appropriate shoes for hiking and take water with you.</span></div>",

The views once you get to Taylor Meadows only get better with each step you take and once you start the final hike to the Black Tusk proper its awe dropping. I started on the Rubble Creek lot which can fill up quickly especially on weekends   The first 4.5 miles are in the forest with a very easy, gentle rising, well maintained and traveled trail. (note, no dogs are allowed once you enter Garibaldi Park).  At 3 miles, take the Taylor meadows trail.    The meadows are classic alpine in nature and the trail gently rises until the junction with the trail to Helm Lake   From there it rises quickly and the views only get better   Garibaldi Lake, the Tantalus Ridge and Panorama Ridge are just a sampling of what you'll see.   The last part of the hike becomes more of a climb as you cross the base of the Tusk on a very narrow trail that leads to the summit chimney to climb  Once up the chimney, its an easy scramble to the top.  On the way back, take a side trip to Garibaldi Lake   Ths is a long all day hike for certain, or if you can get one of the camping spots, make it a multiple day trip</span></div>",

At the time the river was at minimum flow levels and Legend claims that cattle were once driven across and through the river prior to its construction. This leads me to suspect the river being extremely wide can’t be very deep. The length of the piers supporting the bridge clearly indicated that rebar wasn’t used to build the piers as they conform to the Masons rule which says put the wait in the middle third of the brick. Not following this rule will leave the ends of your pier, column, or wall susceptible to tensile loading. (not good) Making the length of the piers somewhat greater than the width of the bridge takes care of this problem. I also noticed the pier sit on bedrock. Piers that sit on a gravel bottom have must be much longer at the bottom than the top on the up stream side to prevent a phenomenon known as scouring. This is what happens when a swift current is able to wash away the gravel under the leading edge of the peer. Over time this can cause the structure to fail. After nearly a ninety years of high spring water flows and floods the bridge is still intact. <br>I suspect the timbers for the bridge were supplied locally during a time when our lumber was not priced by world markets. These timbers were lifted and swung into place by steam cranes guided by men not wearing a fall arrest harness or life jacket. I have not found any record of fatalities on the bridge during its construction.<br>According to the early (aka Pioneers) it took more than twenty years to convince politicians in faraway Victoria to find the money to build the bridge. This timing was fortunate as after two years of construction the bridge was completed just in time for the start of the depression. Had money for the bridge not been found by when it had, construction would have had to wait until after the depression and WWII.<br>  The bridge is made up of 5 spans and holds the title of being the longest wooden span bridge in creativity. The spans on each end of the bridge are approximately 160 feet in length while the three center spans measure about 180 ft. There is a sign on the bridge warning pedestrians not to jump off as I suspect doing so is certain suicide. The water under the bridge may be only 3 feet in depth or less, and being a strong swimmer is not going to help you with this. <br>Seeing the bridge at night is a treat for the eyes as it is lit with multi-colored lights which were added during a recent restoration period. No man-made structure in the Caribou has the eye appeal of the Quesnel River Walking bridge.<br><br>The  Fraser River Bridge in Quesnel.<br>The first time I saw the wooden bridge in Quesnel I found it necessary to read the history of the structure.

(not good) Making the length of the piers somewhat greater than the width of the bridge takes care of this problem. I also noticed the pier sit on bedrock.  Piers set on a gravel bottom have must be much wider at the bottom of the upstream side to prevent a phenomenon called scouring.   This is when a swift current is able to wash away the gravel under the leading edge of the peer.  Over time this can cause the structure to fail.  After nearly a ninety years of high spring water flows and floods the bridge is still intact.  <br>I suspect the timbers for the bridge were supplied locally during a time when our lumber was not priced by world markets.  These timbers were lifted and swung into place by steam cranes guided by men not wearing a fall arrest harness or life jacket.  I have not found any record of fatalities on the bridge during construction.<br>According to the early (aka Pioneers) it took more than twenty years to convince politicians in faraway Victoria to find the money to build the bridge but the timing was fortunate as after two years of construction the bridge was completed in 1929 just in time for the depression.  Had money for the bridge not been found by 1927,  construction would have had to wait until after the depression and WWII.<br>   The bridge is made up of 5 spans and holds the title of being the longest wooden span bridge in creativity.  The spans on each end of the bridge are approximately 160 feet in length while the three center spans measure about 180 ft.  There is a sign on the bridge warning pedestrians not to jump off as doing so is certain suicide.  The water under the bridge may be only 3 feet in depth or less, and being a strong swimmer is not going to help you with this.  <br>Seeing the bridge at night is a treat for the eyes as it is lit with multi-colored lights which were added during a recent restoration period.  No man-made structure in the Caribou has the eye appeal of the Quesnel River Walking bridge.</span></div>",< 1 hour

You MUST reserve 2 days in advance if you want the real deal- white tablecloth, fresh garden flowers, a freshly turned out tea... The owners are genial and interesting. The tea selections were divine. The cheese scones deserve a mention all their own. We learned the secret to perfect cucumber sandwiches and the secret ingredient in the egg salad. Amongst the tarts, scones, sandwiches, sausage rolls, strawberries, raspberry jam and clotted cream were huge slices of strawberry filled sponge cake. The service was lovely, very homey. Lots of people coming in for a cuppa or a bite to eat, or to choose from the rows and rows of candy jars. The soups, chicken pot pies and Cornish pasties are home made. Lots to take out. Shelves stocked with every imaginable bit of British imported foods plus, jams, teas, sauces... A real treat for an afternoon out.</span></div>",

This defeats the entire purpose of having a provincial park, you can either walk 16km  or pay them 160$ to be driven to it, the road is in good conditions so could be easily used by 4x4 vehicles, but this is not allowed.<br><br>I see the point of having no car access, quota 4x4 access, 4x4 road only or 2wd access depending on how undisturbed you want to keep it but not the current system. Not sure why BC would decide to create a provincial park without securing access to it, keeping the area for only affluent people. It's a great spot...an awful provintial park</span></div>",

Besides, what can possibly be bad about a beachside park in Canada where you can gaze at the water with palm trees on the beach? It's great!</span></div>",

After all they are wild animals. I can't 'make' them come out of the forest. But my thoughts were (after seeing the photos of the lodge), that if I didn't see bears, then staying at the lodge in that amazing scenery would be enough. <br><br>And it is! I don't know where to start with my review as this trip was a highlight of my life. Starting with the correspondence in preparing to go and how quickly my emails were always answered, to the sea plane ride in. Wow! What a way to start and end the tour. <br><br>The lodge itself is gorgeous. Sitting on the edge of the mountains, on the water, it's incredibly peaceful, beautiful and serene. Add in a team that work like a family and treat you as though you are part of the family, and you have an experience that I'd pay double what they are asking for. And that's before you even set foot on land to see the bears.<br><br>When I walked into the lodge, it smelt of fresh cookies. Glen (their incredible chef) had been working hard to welcome me with hot cookies straight from the oven. The food was incredible throughout my stay. Glen really pulls out all stops to ensure you enjoy your meals and are kept fed! I was lucky to share thanksgiving with them and it was amazing! I can't thank Glen enough for the effort he put into making my stay incredible.<br><br>Emma was my main guide and she was so knowledgeable, and friendly. She has the experience behind her to know what she is talking about but is able to talk in a way that doesn't make you feel silly. She looked after me and ensured that all my questions were answered and she went out of her way to show me things that she thought would be interesting.<br><br>The lodge is very comfortable. The rooms also. At night it's so dark as you don't have any street lights etc so it makes sleeping amazing.<br><br>And the bears. Well, I was incredibly lucky to see many bears in fabulous different ways. Through the hides, in the boat. Bears swimming, fighting, eating, digging. Mums with cubs, males, youngsters. And it wasn't just bears. The number of bald eagles was stunning. I couldn't believe there were so many to view! In fact there were many different types of birds to watch and listen to. <br><br>I also enjoyed watching the seals that tend to visit the lodge in the mornings, and was lucky to see an otter on my last trip out.<br><br>What I love about Great Bear Nature Tours though is how much they respect the bears and the country they live in. They ensure the bears come first. Conservation is part of what they do, ensuring that we humans leave as little impact as possible so the bears live in as natural a state as is possible.<br><br>I 'happened' to come across the Great Bear Nature Tours by fluke as I was googling where I could see bears in America as I had a 'week spare' to fill in. Because of this, I had no choice of when I would see them. I happened to be there at the end of the salmon season which was a brilliant time to go. The bears were lovely and big and fat. But were still hunting the salmon. There were lovely cubs around and I also got to see how the salmon affected the eco system.<br><br>There are a couple of things you need to think about and realize will happen as you go on this adventure.... you sit quietly in a hide for several hours. When there are bears around, the time goes quickly, but if not, then it can be cold (depending on the season) thankfully the big puffy suits (while not attractive, grin) provided by the lodge are incredibly warm!  And as I will mention below the scenery more than makes up for any quietness in the bear activity.<br><br>You are really close to the bears, but to get great shots, you will still need a good zoom lens. Sometimes the light isn't great as the sun starts to set, so ensure you know what you're doing with your camera to avoid shaking and low light.<br><br>So lets talk about the scenery......well, it overwhelmed me. The mist that rolls in and makes everything so magical. The mirror like waterways. The towering mountains. The trees dripping with moss. The waterfalls. It is surreal to be in a place that is so beautiful. You forget there are places like this in the world, and really it would have been enough just to stay in this beauty without the bears. But hey, being realistic, the bears are a major bonus!<br><br>I know there is so much more to say, but words don't describe a trip that had me crying when I left. I knew that I had just experienced something very very special that would be hard to ever replicate.</span></div>",

The walk around is about 3km, and there are several spots that access the lake. It was a sunny day, and we ran into many people fishing. (small Rainbow Trout were being caught, and we were told the lake is stocked) <br><br>The trail is well groomed and there is no chance of getting lost, making it a great trail for families with young children. (I also noticed an older crowd enjoying the trail) The trail has beautiful mature trees, and we saw many bird varieties including an Osprey. There are also ""points of interest"" along the way, which were fascinating. All a part of BC's history. <br><br>The trails in this area are exceptionally well marked. We opted to just go around the lake, as we had little ones with us, but there are trails leading off the main one that make for a longer hike. There is also a floating bridge where people were fishing that was pretty cool. <br><br>In the main area near the parking lot, (at the end of Lillooet Road, pass Capilano College), is a nature lodge, outhouses, picnic tables and a wooden gazebo; lots of great places for a picnic lunch. I also noticed several people bike riding, although I didn't see any on the trail we were on. <br><br>Easy access from Hwy.1, amenities, and beautiful well-groomed trails, make this spot perfect for a family outing.</span></div>",

There is no internet or cell service and the staff I encountered were out to lunch, so plan ahead and know the area (tip i failed to follow closely enough: download your maps of the area in detail before hand).

It starts off very narrow and steep and the surface is very loose gravel. Then it becomes very steep and rutted ( ( by water runoff)  going down hill. Unfortunately although the views above the Columbia Valley were great we decided to turn back half way along. I have to admit that the next day we had a fantastic ride on our road bikes along the new Legacy trail from Invermere.I think the Old Coach trail is fine for avid mountain bikes but not for families.It does need a little maintenance.However the information boards are excellent.</span></div>",

We followed our bear etiquette and backed off down the road away from the bear, who crossed the road and went down through a field. We spent the next part of the hike figuring out what we might have done if we had encountered the bear on that narrow, steep section!

What a wonderful surprise it was.  Although we visited during a school field trip, we were able to view all the displays and there were many.  The Mining processes, the early photos, the displays that showed early life in the region.  What a treat it was.  The staff were very accommodating and although we visited during the first graders tour, we were still able to enjoy all the showcases and marvel at the diversity of their collection.  It was close to the city (6km from town center), easy to locate, you can’t miss the HUGE MUSEUM sign on the side of the building after coming off Canning Road.  What a pleasure.  The inexpensive entrance fee suited the site very well.  Drop by, it is a nice diversion if you are in Grand Forks.</span></div>",

Thank you for visiting the winery.  During this pandemic, Harper's Trail had to recreate what a tasting looks like and for us, it doesn't come close to what tastings used to be. For the safety of our team and visitors, a self-pour, self-guided tasting is what we came up with. Our team is working hard to make each visit fun and memorable and for most, we are hitting the mark! It's unfortunate that you didn't enjoy your experience. However, we sincerely hope you will enjoy the wines you purchased.
With regards to not waiving the tasting fees, we are transparent with that information. 
It is presented at time of booking, written on the info board at the front door as well as on the website. The reason it isn't waived, is you receive a full 5 ounces of wine during your tasting as well as 30 minutes, seated to enjoy. In our opinion, $5.75 is worth that. There isn't anywhere we know of that you will get a 5 oz glass of VQA wine for that price.

Cheers~.

I was also chagrined that I had missed coming here for such a long time although I was within an easy day's drive. The turnoff for the park is at Parsons, and the route is signed from there going 50 kms toward the mountains on a good quality gravel road. You do have to take care to see the sign that angles you to the right near the few buildings that make up the town. If you make a left at the store, the back roads continue endlessly. Parsons is south of Golden and north of Radium Hot Springs. When I arrived at the parking lot I spied all the vehicles elaborately surrounded with skirts of wire mesh held down with poles and rocks. This is keep the friendly porcupines and other eager critters from nipping away are the precious innards and tires of your vehicle. The park kindly provides large quantities of materials with which you can protect your (precious) transportation. The trail is no nonsense, quickly beginning a steep climb up the mountainside. Soon the marvellous views begin of a large glacier cascading down a precipitous mountainside, with pinnacles protruding out of the ice. I climbed 1,000 meters up to the Applebee Campground, which is a strictly barebones camping location on solid rock. The views were truly extraordinary, with airy views of portions of the vast icecap, and Patagonia-like rock spires that are a mecca for climbers. For those who wish more comfort, the Conrad Kain Hut can be booked. It is 250 meters below the higher campground at which I stayed. There is also another campground at that level (Boulder Campground). While i was there in September, the weather was highly variable, ranging from sunny, blue skies, to rain, to snow and ice pellets. A fierce wind came up quickly and dissipated just as fast. The place is known for radical, rapid changes in weather and one must go up there well prepared. It is one of the most dramatic places I have visited in BC. I didn't head out onto the glaciated area, but, for those equipped to do so, the vistas are extraordinary. This is a route for the fit. Doing it as a day hike is possible, but it is much better to take some time to appreciate the spectacular surroundings.</span></div>",More than 3 hours

The campground itself is nestled up in the forrest and we found the sites quite private. The lake is about a 5 min drive or a 15 min walk, (not one I'd want to make at the end of the day). My daughter and I often walked down to the lake, while our son rode his bike and husband drove. When ready to go back to the campground we just jumped in the truck as its a looong steep walk back up. The lake is gorgeous. We sunbathed, swam (a little seaweedy), canoed and most importantly fished while at the lake. We caught tons of fish off the dock. <br>There is also a hiking trail leaving from both the lake and the campground. The view at the end of the trail is not to be missed. Mostly a very easy walk, but gets steep at the end. Don't veer off the trail and you should make it up fine. </span></div>",

He's an insane skier with several avalanche courses under his belt.  He said to me, ""this is the place to go.""  At age 57, my skiing peaked thirty years ago.  And although my wife, Karen is a great skier, my two teenage daughters are advanced intermediates.  My concern was that we would slow down other skiers in our snow cat that were intent on getting maximum vertical.  I need not worry.  What I found was that Chatter Creek is such a supportive experience.  The snow cats are custom, warm and cozy, and create an environment for people to be social.  Maybe it's a Canadian thing, but everyone is so nice that it just rubs off on all the guests. The skiing is truly amazing but it's also an incredible/terrific experience.  My eldest daughter told me, ""Dad, you did it. I'm a skier for life!""  My fourteen year old daughter was incredibly brave.  She was one of the youngest girls  ever.  They said they have had younger boys, one 12 year old, but not many girls.  Stefan, our guide, toasted my daughter the last day, and it was such a thrill for her.  There's clearly a reason so many people go multiple times. . .On the other hand, there are many obstacles, including boulders, tree wells, and boulder crevasses.  Many times I would stand on one side of a drop-off looking into a vast sea of powder and pillars (boulders covered in snow) knowing that I absolutely had to fully commit: Jump, go straight or have a nasty fall.  And, you don't want to fall.  The key to skiing Chatter Creek is to never fall because getting out of the deep snow zaps your strength.   Be honest with yourself.  If you're not up for a huge challenge best go somewhere else.  And, if you have a family of motivated teenagers - go for it!</span></div>",More than 3 hours

The snowshoeing trails were well marked and reasonably long. The weather restricted our climb to the higher points of the hillsides.

This walk is achievable with kids but it isn't as easy as some of these reviews make it out to be.  We went with a 3 year old and a 5 year old and my 3 year old struggled as it is a moderately steep incline pretty much most of the way.  She repeatedly said she was tired and needed a few breaks while going up.  Overall though even with the short breaks it took us under 20 minutes to get to the top.  I was thinking though when we were there that the walk is way harder on a kid than I had anticipated after reading the reviews on here, so just beware of that.  You can definitely do it with small kids but it's not like a low long hill, it's more of a short moderate hill, but you are walking up hill most of the time.<br>All that being said I'm glad we went, we were up and back in 30 mins, and unfortunately it poured rain the entire time haha ;) but afterwards my kids got a special treat lunch at the IHOP that isn't too far away and they enjoyed drying off there with their cupcake pancakes!</span></div>",

First things first, the mosquitos are NO JOKE here in the summer months. I was dumb and didn't bring insect repellent but as there are three lakes to visit on this hike there are large swarms of mosquitos that huddle near the water's edge waiting for some tasty morsels of animal blood to devour. Don't be a victim. <br><br>I got here around 11am and the main parking lot was full but don't worry there is another parking area across the road and down a ways that you can park in. Honestly, I'd say you probably should park there as it's easier to get out of that lot as opposed to the main lot. <br><br>They have vault toilets before you head out on the trail and a decent map to take note of so that you know where you're going. You might not need it since it's really only one course and....it's all...up....hill. <br><br>The first lake is very close to the parking lot, maybe about 1/2 of a mile/50 meters). The first lake was where I knew I was in trouble with the mosquitos. They tore me up..big time! Of course,​ it doesn't itch right away but just wait. I did spend a decent amount of time swatting and smacking my skin along the hike because mosquitos are super sneaky. Nonetheless, the first lake was gorgeous. It's just a taste of the lakes to come. The sun hadn't come out fully yet so it didn't give off the super fluorescent green-blue hue that you often see in pics. Due to the mosquitos, I​ hurriedly made my way to get back on the trail to the second lake. The sign says it's 1.86 miles/3km from the ​first lake to the​ ​ second lake. It's 2.49 miles/4 km from the​ ​first lake t​o the third lake. It seemed like the trail was at a 45 degree angle the entire 2.5 ish miles. There are also steps within the angle of the trail. I believe it's about 1300 elevation gain. I'm not going to lie, this trail is tough but not too tough. I would say it's definitely not a beginner hike. It's a beautiful hike though. There are lots of points where you just look out at the surrounding mountains and lush hillsides and it's just very peaceful. The trail wasn't super busy even at 11am-12pm. People were pretty courteous but a lot of people don't understand yielding the right-of-way or allowing faster hikers the right to pass, but just be patient. Take your time and don't rush. You are out in nature remember. Enjoy it! <br><br>There is no water on or near the trail that is drinkable so make sure you bring enough water and maybe a few snacks. Surprisingly, I made it to the ​second lake in about an hour but some people that I passed on the trail took about 2-2.5 hours. Once you get to the ​second lake, take time to enjoy it.  There really aren't words to describe​ accurately how marvelous the color of the lake is. Don't fret if the sun isn't out right away, it should peek out from the behind the clouds and you can see the shine of the lake of antifreeze. Just kidding it's not that green but more blue-green. I thought there would be a lot of selfie sticks and Instagrammers​ blocking all the view but people were actually ENJOYING nature without just trying to take pics. Just lovely!<br><br>I decided not to go to the ​third lake because seeing the​ ​ second lake was actually enough for me, plus I wanted to get back to the border by around 6pm so I had a bit of a time crunch. It's only about another mile from the second lake though just in case you decide to keep going.  <br><br>Overall, I will definitely be back if I'm in the area and do a few other hikes probably in Garibaldi or near the Wedgemount glacier. It's a wonderful drive to get there, a calm and clean hike, and a spectacular surprise ending once you get to each of the lakes</span></div>",

The resort itself, once you step on to it, is non-smoking. That's OK. Now, considering that we ordered our tickets virtually, we figured it made sense to walk straight to the lift that would take us up to the ride. As it turns out, regardless of whether you retrieved your ticket virtually, you have to enter the line at the guest services to upgrade your ticket. There, standing in line, we discovered that it was actually a FOUR HOUR WAIT TIME TO GET ONTO THE PIPELINE COASTER... but don't worry, they offer all day bike passes for eighty bucks, and that's not including the rental you would have to order to be able to while away the four hour wait. By the way, the line up to guest services was full of people bickering and complaining about the same thing--THE FOUR HOUR WAIT. Gutless!</span></div>",More than 3 hours

I've been to Krause Berry Farms 3-4 times over the last few years and every time I'm disappointed by the wait and service at the waffle stand. Our visit in August 2021 was the last straw and I finally had to leave a review. We arrived on a Sunday morning shortly after the waffle stand opened. There were about 15 families ahead of us. It took over 45 minutes to order and receive our waffles. Krause Farms was only selling waffles with blueberry toppings that day and had 7 kids working behind the counter so it blows my mind that it took that long. The kids making the waffles were standing around and chatting. Even though they have about 15 waffle irons, the kids were only using 5-6 of them at any given time. Even though each kid had a station on the waffle making line, none of them seemed to hustle even though the line was getting longer. The young staff could really use some adult supervision. I've never seen anyone who looked older than 20 on the waffle line. The fresh fruit on the waffle is nice but the waffle itself is a glorified DIY hotel waffle that Krause Berry charges $13 for. I'm all for a leisurely morning breakfast but it's painful to watch these inefficient kids behind the counter struggle to make the same waffle over-and-over at such a slow pace. As I said, this is not the first time we've experienced this kind of wait at the Krause waffle line. I'd always chalked it up to it being early in the season or a new staff but after 4 visits of the same slowness, I think these kids know they can get away with slow service.</span></div>",

It's a prime example of a temperate rainforest, with all sorts of odd fungi and ferns and mosses growing beneath towering second-growth cedar and hemlock trees.  Watch for the banana-slugs!  <br><br>In summer the park is packed with tourists but once you know your way around there are plenty of quieter swimming pools downstream of the suspension bridge and main 80-foot pool (where people converge to watch the show of cliff-jumpers).  I'm not telling you where they are - come find them yourself!  Some pools are quite shaded, cupped between towering canyon walls.  And the water is ALWAYS cold :c)<br><br>The suspension bridge and lower ""Twin Falls"" bridge are most thrilling in winter months when we're experiencing our heavy ""monsoon"" rains.  Watch for kayakers downstream of Twin Falls when the water is really raging!  Hiking in wetter weather is nice in Lynn Canyon because the trees form an umbrella to shield much of the rain.  You'll need good boots or runners though, as the trails get mucky and the roots quite slippery.  If you follow the trail downstream on the east side of Twin Falls, which is also part of the Baden Powell trail at this point, you can connect to the rough but well marked ""Old Lillooet"" Trail, which takes you further downstream to Inter-River Park.  Or, challenge yourself to climb the stairs up from the 80-foot pool and wander into the LSCR (Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve), to stroll around Rice Lake, or further upstream on Lynn Creek to the Lynn Headwaters Park.<br>~jw<br></span></div>",1-2 hours

You must stop and see Shannon Falls and Brandywine Falls. Not only are they impressive to watch, but also free. One more time: it's free. Another thing I liked was that the hike to the falls were not very long, yet beautiful. There are markers along the highway that indicate the native American influence (or aboriginal, as they call it). At least, read a few and enjoy the scenery as you stop off. If you're new to the area, check your fuel before going. There are gas stations in different towns, but charting unknown territory requires checking your fuel level. Enjoy!</span></div>",
